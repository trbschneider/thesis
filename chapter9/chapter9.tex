\chapter[Scan/rescan in the corpus callosum]{Scan/rescan reproducibility in the corpus callosum and spinal cord}
\section{Introduction}
In the previous chapter we have presented a clinical {\SF} ActiveAx protocols that can be acquired in under 25 minutes scan time. The main motivation for the previous study was to compare our short {\SF} protocol with the 1h long \OI{} protocol of \citep{Alexander:2010}. We found that our \SF{} protocols are quite capable of achieving comparable results to the \OI{} method with only a quarter of acquisitions needed. While we focussed our work on the optimisation of the gradient scheme, we left the imaging setup unchanged from the original \OI{} approach. However, our results suggest that a careful optimisation of all imaging parameters, such as accurate positioning and image resolution and quality have a key role in achieving acceptable and reproducible estimates of tissue microstructure parameters. 


We therefore present here an new imaging pipeline, which improves on the following key areas study setup from the previous setup: (i) we use of a small \gls{FOV} imaging sequence to increase both image resolution and SNR (ii) be better method to align the image volume with the dominant fibre direction of the CC using fast DTI tractography directly on the scanner console (iii) a further improved \SF{} optimisation algorithm and tissue model to allow the shortest \gls{TE} for individual diffusion acquisitions to improve SNR in low diffusion weighted scans.  We test our approach in 5 healthy volunteers, who were scanned at two different timepoint to assess both intra- and inter-subject reproducibility. 


\section{Methods \& Experiments}
\subsection*{Protocol optimisation}
We use here a slightly modified version of the \SFasym{} optimisation, which we described detail in Section~\ref{XX} of the previous chapter. We adapt the tissue model to include an additional T2 decay factor that accounts for signal loss in the DWI with respect to the \gls{TE}. For simplicity, we assume here a mono-exponential T2 decay of the signal. Previously, the \gls{TE} was governed by the maximum TE in the whole protocol. This modification now allows the use of dynamic \glspl{TE} for different PGSE parameters in the protocol optimisation. This has the advantage of effectively reducing the \gls{TE} in the low DWI acquisition, which improves the SNR in those acquisitions.



We carry out the optimisation using as before, assuming a T2 decay factor of 70ms typical for white matter (WM) in the CC \cite{cite stanisz relaxation times paper}. We further increase the maximum usable gradient strength to 87mT/m, by combining the perpendicular 62mT/m gradients using our modified scanner firmware (as implemented earlier see \ref{XX}). We further add a single shell DTI acquisition (max b=800s/mm2, 1 b=0, 16 uniformly distributed directions) to our protocols to improve fitting. The full protocol is given in Table \ref{tab:chap9 protocol table}.

\subsection*{Data acquisition}
We recruited 5 healthy volunteers (3 female, 2 male, mean age=XX +/- YY) to be scanned on a Philips Achieva 3TX scanner. All subjects were recalled for a second scan on adifferent day days to assess the intra-subject reproducibility of the experiment. In each scan session we acquire a the optimised \SF{} DWI protocol with following scan parameters: voxel size: 1x1x4mm3, FOV=96x96mm2, TR=6000ms, 2 averages, using an outer-volume suppressed ZOOM acquisition [6] to avoid fold-over artifacts.  
\paragraph{}
The previous experiments have shown that our \SF{} methods benefit from accurate alignment of the gradient scheme with respect to the dominant fibre direction. While standard T2w localizers is adequate to align the scan volume to anatomical reference, it offers no information about the WM fibre orientation. To aid slice positioning, we acquire a fast DTI scan in addition to the conventional scout scans. The scout-DTI imaging parameters are as follows: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXx. We use the PRIDE tools directly on the scan console to place a ROI in the mid-sagittal slice of the CC and perform FACT tractography on the DTI dataset (FA threshold=0.45, angle threshold=YY). The tracts are then overlayed on the colour-coded FA map, rasterised, and resliced to obtain a new 1x1x1 image volume. We use the axial and coronal views of the tractography results to adjust the angulation of the \SF{} image volume with respect to the observed tracts.  Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 FOV positioning} shows an example of the final slice alignment based on both the structural localizer scan and tractography results. Since the whole scout-DTI processing is performed on the scanner console, the additional scan setup time by acquiring analysing the scout-DTI scan is kept to a minimum.

\subsection*{Post-processing}
We compensate for motion during the acquisition by aligning all scan volumes to the first b=0 image by an rigid registration method\cite{XX} as implemented in \cite{niftyreg}. To avoid registration artifacts in the diffusion weighted images, we only register the interleaved b=0 images and apply the estimated transformation matrix to the subsequent intermediate b>0 images.   

To ensure anatomical correspondence between scan and rescan, we then register the rescan dataset to the scan dataset (using rigid registration) using the transformation estimates from registering  the first b=0 images of the two datasets. The transformation matrices for intra-scan motion and scan/rescan alignment are combined before applying them to the dataset to avoid unnecessary multiple interpolations. The data is then smoothed using the Unbiased Non-Local Means filter \citep{Aja-Fernandez:2010} with a filter radius of $3x3x1$.

\subsection*{Data analysis}
We use the same fitting procedure as outlined in the previous chapters. However since we allowed for variable TE in each acquisition, we need to account for the resulting differences in T2 single decay within the data. We therefore estimate the voxel-wise mono-exponential decay curve using a linear regression model based on the non-diffusion-weighted acquisitions. The predicted MR signal $S$ from the tissue model is then adjusted based on its \glspl{TE} by:
\begin{equation}
	S' = S * exp(TE/T2).
\end{equation}
The adjusted signal S' is then used to compute the rician log-likelihood with the observed signal as previously. We computed the posterior distributions of the model parameters using an MCMC method on a voxel-by-voxel basis. From the mean of the posterior distribution we compute the the axon diameter index $a$ and axonal density index $\rho$=f/$\pi/a^2$. In addition we also fitted the diffusion tensor to the 16-direction DTI data and derive the principal eigenvectors $v1$--$v3$ and scalar maps of FA, MD, AD, RD. All fitting are implemented using the open-source Camino toolkit \citep{Cook:2009}.
\subsection*{ROI analysis} In each subject we manually segmented roughly the CC on the mid-sagittal slice. We then excluded voxels from the CC mask where either FA<0.5 or v1 deviated more than 10 degrees from the dominant CC fibre direction. The CC segmentation is then divided in 10 equidistant regions along the anterior-posterior baseline similar to \cite{Aboitiz}. Figure \ref{XX} shows an example of the CC subdivision in one subject. Mean $a$ and $\rho$ indices are then computed for each CC subdivision in each of the 10 datasets. Scan/rescan agreement is assessed visually as well as it is quantified by computing the \gls{ICC} \citep{Shrout:1979} over the whole CC and in each \gls{ROI}. To investigate the correlation between DTI metrics and $a$ and $\rho$, we pool all values in the CC ROI of all subjects separately for scan and rescan and report the robust correlation coefficient \citep{XX}. All statistical processing was performed using the software R\citep{RCoreTeam:2012} with packages 'ICC'\citep{Wolak:2011} and 'robust'\citep{Wang:2012}.

\section{Results}
%Figure 1 shows an example of the obtained d and ρ maps and the CC subdivision. Figure 2 shows plots of d and ρ over the CC subdivisions for each subject. Figure 3 shows the axon diameter index and standard deviation over all subjects in each CC region for scan and rescan experiments. In all subjects we find the highest values of d (12.5-13.5μm) in regions B1-I and smaller values between 9-11.5μm for d in the anterior genu (G1-G2) and splenium regions (S1-S3).  Similarly we find the highest axonal density in genu and splenium and low density in the mid-body regions. These trends are in excellent agreement with studies of post-mortem CC, which report highest number of large fibres between B1 and I [9] and low fibre density [10] compared to genu and splenium. The high estimates of d compared to reported post-mortem values can be explained by the shrinkage of axons due to histological preparation. Also the limited gradient strength available on the clinical MRI system makes the experiment insensitive to small fibres, as shown e.g. by [11]. Therefore we can postulate that differences between CC regions in our experiment are mainly driven by the presence of larger fibres. 
%Scan/rescan reproducibility:  Figure 2 and 3 show good agreement between d and ρ values in all regions consistently in all subjects. We find the variability of d to be less than 10\% between scan and rescan in each subject, with the largest relative difference found in the genu and splenium (6±5\% variation) and lowest in the mid-body (<3±2\%). As seen in Figure 3, inter-subject variability is below 0.8μm in d and 0.01μm-2 in ρ in both scan and rescan experiments. Standard deviation is lowest in the mid-body (0.3μm) measurement and larger in genu and splenium regions (>0.7μm). Similarly, in ρ we observe low variability in the mid-body (0.001-0.002μm -2) and higher intra-subject variability in the posterior part of the CC, particularly in the splenium (0.005-0.01μm-2). 
\subsection*{Axon diameter and axon density indices}
Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 scan rescan maps per subject} shows side-by-side scan/rescan maps of $a$ and $\rho$ for all five subjects. Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 scan rescan scatterplots per subject} summarizes the mean $a$ and $\rho$ parameters measured in each ROI for all five subjects. In all subjects we can clearly see the variation along AP we expect from previous experiment and earlier studies \citep{Alexander:2010}. Furthermore, in comparison with those earlier results, our maps appear considerably less noisy and show improved contrast between different CC regions. Consistent with our previous results, we estimate values of $a$ in the range of 5--15$\mu m$. The largest $a$ estimates are found in the midbody of the CC. The smallest $a$ values are found in the splenium <8$\mu m$ and the anterior part of the genu (9--11$\mu m$). The axon density index $\rho$ is reciprocal to the $a$ trends, with $\rho$ being largest in the anterior genu and posterior splenium regions  (XX--XY) and smallest in the body and isthmus of the CC. Axons too large!! The $a$ and $\rho$ pattern we observe here agrees very well with the microstructure that is seen in excised human CC tissue samples ().


Unlike in the previous experiments, the high spatial resolution here provides a large number of voxels that are completely contained in the CC. As a consequence, the CC can be easily distinguished from surrounding tissue and the tissue parameter estimates are less influenced by CSF contamination, particularly in the thinning part of the CC (B3--S1). This is beneficial for subjects with smaller CC such as found in s2 \& s3, but becomes even more important in view of future applications in patients with neurological diseases such as MS or Alzheimers disease, who often suffer from severe CC atrophy.

\subsection*{Inter- \& Intra-subject reproducibility}
The visual assessment of scan and rescan results already indicates that ROI-wise microstructure estimates are very consistent between the five subjects. As shown in Figure~\ref{}, the average results over all 5 subjects are very similar between scan and rescan experiment, both in the average trend as well as in the observed standard deviation. Moreover, both $a$ and $\rho$ show very little variation from the mean over all subjects. Inter-subject variation is lower in the mid-body and the proximal genu regions (G2--G3) than in the more distal anterior and posterior regions. The Bland-Altman plots shown in Figure \ref{fig:chapter9 bland altman} show good scan/rescan variation independent of parameter estimate with the majority of ROI estimates within the 95\% confidence interval. Few ROI outliers which exhibit rather scan/rescan large variation. Scan/rescan variation appears unsystematic in $a$. However in $\rho$, the large axon density estimates appear more unstable than smaller $\rho$ values. Outliers appear mostly in the most distal G1 and S3 regions. Such large variations might indicate cardiac pulsation artifacts as these regions are closest to the adjacent Arteria Cerebralis. 


Table~\ref{tab:XXX} presents the ICC values \gls{ICC} for whole CC and individual ROIs. For both $a$ and $\rho$, we find the scan/rescan agreement being 'moderate' or better for both whole CC values and most ROIs. As noted before, the lowest ICC values are found in boundary regions (G1) or in the thin proximal part of the CC, which are most affected by imaging and analysis artefacts. Both Bland-Altman analysis as well as the ICC suggests that estimated values in those ROIs appear more prone to error and must be interpreted with caution.

	\label{fig:chap 9 DTI correlations}	
\end{figure}	
Figure~\ref{fig:chap 9 DTI correlations} presents the correlation between the standard DTI metrics and the $a$ and $\rho$ estimates. The correlations we see here agree with the findings of \citep{Barazany:2009} and \citep{Alexander:2010}. While $MD$ is not correlated either of the microstructure indices, the directional diffusivities $AD$ and $RD$ both show moderate correlations with $a$ and $\rho$. Of course it is not surprising to find $RD$ negatively correlated with $a$ and positively correlated with $\rho$ respectively, as it is know both axonal packing density, and axon diameter all influence $RD$ measurements \citep{Beaulieu:2002}. The observed correlation between $AD$ and $a$ (positive) and $\rho$ (negative) is less intuitively explainable, however consistent with previous findings \citep{Barazany:2009,Alexander:2010}. Alexander et al. speculate that the increase of axon size and decrease of packing density are associated with lower fibre coherency, and thus are causing an increasing amount of diffusion impedance along the dominant diffusion direction. The correlation between AD and the $a$ and $\rho$ indices might also be the result of varying CSF contamination, since the regions high axon diameter are mostly found in the thinner midbody region are more affected by partial volume effects than genu and splenium. Finally, the correlation between $FA$ and $a$ and $\rho$, follows the association between our indices $a$ and $\rho$ with AD and RD.

\section{Discussion}
This work presents a novel imaging and analysis pipeline for measuring axon diameter and density indices in the CC in-vivo, which expands on our \SFasym{} protocol optimisation we introduced in the previous chapter. We combined small FOV imaging and careful optimisation of the MR protocols and post-processing techniques to gain both high spatial resolution while maximising SNR. We show here axon diameter and axon density maps of better quality than previous studies have shown before. For the first time present results of a larger subject cohort of 5 subjects, allowing to infer scan and rescan reproducibilty with more confidence. Our results show that $a$ and $\rho$ show very good reproducibility consistently over all investigated subjects. While the correlation analysis shows a significant overlap between $a$ and $\rho$ with conventional DTI parameters, the consistency and reproducibility is promising 



 We have demonstrated that our microstructure estimates agree with reported post-mortem evaluation of the CC fibre density distribution. Further, we showed good inter- and intra-subject reproducibility. The scan time of the protocol is short enough to be easily incorporated into clinical studies. In future work, we are planning to use this approach in subjects with known altered microstructure of the CC.
