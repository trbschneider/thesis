\chapter[Microstructure estimates in CC and SC]{Viability and repeatability of microstructure estimation in the corpus callosum and spinal cord}
\section{Introduction}
In the previous chapter we have presented an implementation of our {\SFasym} optimised protocols on a clinical system. We found that the 25 minute long \SFasym{} acquisition can produce comparable results to the \~3 times longer \OI{} method. Our initial work was focussed only on the optimisation of the acquisition protocol. However, clerly other non-diffusion related imaging parameters, such as accurate positioning or spatial resolution, also contribute significantly to the goodness of the parameter estimates coming from our protocol. In this chapter we address several shortcomings of the initial \SFasym{} setup. Our main aim is to improve SNR and spatial resolution of our dataset in order to maximise accuracy and  reproducibility of our microstructure maps. 


In detail, we make the following changes compared to the \SFasym{} experiment described in in Chapter~\ref{chapter8}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We use of a small \gls{FOV} imaging sequence to increase image resolution and reduce distortions.
\item We develop a new method to better align the image volume with the dominant fibre direction of the CC using fast DTI tractography directly on the scanner console.
\item We extend the signal model used in the optimisation and fitting to allow the use of shortest available \gls{TE} for different combination of \gls{smalldel} and \gls{bigdel}, which will maximise SNR for each acquisition individually.
\item We increase the nominal maximal gradient strength to 87mT/m using the the modified scanner software we developed for the QSI study in Chapter~\ref{chapter7}. Stronger gradients should aid the performance of the axon diameter parameters \citep{Dyrby:2010}. Stronger gradient also allow for shorter gradient pulses, which will further improve SNR.
\end{enumerate}
We applied our new imaging pipeline in 5 healthy volunteers, who were scanned at two different timepoint to assess both intra- and inter-subject reproducibility. Furthermore we propose the first implementation of our \SFasym{} protocol in the cervical spine and test it in one healthy volunteer. 


\section{Methods \& Experiments}
\subsection*{Protocol optimisation}
We use the same \SFasym{} optimisation as described in Chapter~\ref{chapter9}, but with one modification: we extend the tissue model to include an additional T2 decay factor that accounts for signal loss in the DWI with respect to the \gls{TE} on a per-acquisition basis. For simplicity, we assume here a mono-exponential T2 decay of the signal. Previously, the \gls{TE} was governed by the largest TE in the whole protocol. This modification now allows the dynamic use of \glspl{TE} for different $(\gls{smalldel},\gls{bigdel})$ settings in the protocol optimisation. This has the advantage of effectively reducing the \gls{TE} in the low DWI acquisition, which improves greatly the SNR in those acquisitions.

We carry out the optimisation using the same optimisation parameters as described in the previous Chapters (see Table~\ref{sec:chapter 8 optimisation parameters} for details). We further assume T2=70ms, which is typical for white matter (WM) in the CC \citep{}. We also use our modified scanner software (described in Chapter~\ref{chapter7}), which allows us to combine several orthogonal 62mT/m-gradients to increase the maximum gradient strength to 87mT/m for the perpendicular gradients. The maximum gradient strength for the parallel gradient direction was 62mT/m. To improve directional resolution required for the fit of the diffusion direction, we add a single shell DTI acquisition (max b=800s/mm$^2$, 1 b=0, 16 uniformly distributed directions) to the optimised protocol. The full set of parameters is given in Table \ref{tab:chap9 protocol table}.

\subsection{CC reproducibility study}
\subsubsection*{Data acquisition}
We recruited 5 healthy volunteers (3 female, 2 male, mean age=28 $\pm$ ) to be scanned on a Philips Achieva 3TX scanner. All subjects were recalled for a second scan on a different day to assess the intra-subject reproducibility of the experiment. In each scan session we acquire a the optimised \SF{} DWI protocol with following scan parameters: voxel size: 1x1x4mm$^3$, FOV=96x96mm$^2$, TR=6000ms, 2 averages, using an outer-volume suppressed ZOOM acquisition \citep{Wilm:2007} to avoid fold-over artifacts. The scan were performed in sagittal-oblique orientation, aligned with the AC-PC line.
\paragraph{}
The previous experiments have shown that our \SF{} methods benefit from accurate alignment of the gradient scheme with respect to the dominant fibre direction. While standard T2w localizers are adequate to align the scan volume to anatomical reference, it offers no information about the WM fibre orientation. To aid slice positioning, we acquire a fast DTI scan in addition to the conventional scout scans. The scout-DTI imaging parameters are as follows: voxelsize=2x2x4mm$^3$, 16 slices, FOV=232x232 mm$^2$, TE=78ms, TR=4200ms, 6 non-colinear diffusion weighted directions (b=1000) plus one non-diffusion weighted image. Total scan time of the scout DTI scan is 57 seconds. We use the PRIDE tools directly on the scan console to place a ROI in the mid-sagittal slice of the CC and perform FACT tractography on the DTI dataset (FA threshold=0.45, angle threshold=YY). The tracts are then overlayed on the colour-coded FA map, rasterised, and resliced to obtain a new 1x1x1 image volume. To plan the final \SF{} scan, we use the axial and coronal views of the tractography results to adjust the angulation of the axial slices with respect to the observed tracts.  Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 FOV positioning} shows an example of the final slice alignment based on both the structural localizer scan and tractography results. Since the whole scout-DTI processing is performed on the scanner console, the additional scan setup time by acquiring analysing the scout-DTI scan is kept to a minimum.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{Post-processing}
We compensate for motion during the acquisition by aligning all scan volumes to the first b=0 image using the block-wise rigid registration algorithm \citep{Ourselin:2001} implemented in \citep{Modat:2010}. However, since the diffusion weighted images provide little contrast in non-coherently aligned WM tissue, we only register the interleaved b=0 images and apply the estimated transformation matrix to the subsequent intermediate b>0 images.   

To ensure anatomical correspondence between scan and rescan, we then register the rescan dataset to the scan dataset (using rigid registration) using the transformation estimates from registering  the first b=0 images of the two datasets. The transformation matrices for intra-scan motion and scan/rescan alignment are combined before applying them to the dataset to avoid unnecessary multiple interpolations. The data is then smoothed using the Unbiased-Non-Local-Means filter \citep{Tristan-Vega:2012} with a small filter radius of $3\times3\times4 mm^3$.

\subsubsection*{Data analysis}
We use the same fitting procedure as outlined in the previous chapters. However since we allowed for variable TE in each acquisition, we need to account for the resulting differences in T2 signal decay within the data. We therefore estimate the voxel-wise mono-exponential decay curve using a linear regression model based on the non-diffusion-weighted acquisitions only. The predicted MR signal $S$ from the tissue model is then adjusted based on its \glspl{TE} by:
\begin{equation}
	S' = S * exp(-TE/T2)
\end{equation}
before the other model parameters are fitted. The adjusted signal S' is used to compute the rician log-likelihood with the observed signal as before. As in the previous studies, we compute the posterior distributions of the model parameters using an MCMC method on a voxel-by-voxel basis. From the mean of the posterior distribution we compute the the axon diameter index $a$ and axonal density index $\rho$=f/$\pi/a^2$. In addition we also fitted the diffusion tensor to the 16-direction DTI data and derive the principal eigenvector $v1$ and scalar maps of FA, MD, AD, RD. All fitting is implemented using the Camino toolkit \citep{Cook:2006}.

	\label{fig:chap9 CC ROIs}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection*{ROI analysis} 
In each subject we manually segmented the CC on the mid-sagittal slice on a non-diffusion weighted volume of the \gls{DWI} dataset. We then remove all voxels from the CC mask with FA<0.5 to exclude voxels with more than one single fibre orientation or significant CSF contamination. We further exclude voxel from the analysis where v1 deviated more than 10 degrees from the left-right fibre orientation we assumed in the protocol optimisation. The CC segmentation is then divided in 10 equidistant regions along the anterior-posterior baseline similar to \cite{Aboitiz:1992}. Figure \ref{fig:chap9 CC ROIs} shows an example of the CC subdivision in one subject. Mean $a$ and $\rho$ indices are then computed for each CC subdivision in each of the 10 datasets. Scan/rescan agreement is assessed visually as well as it is quantified by computing the \gls{ICC} \citep{Shrout:1979} over the whole CC and in each \gls{ROI}. To investigate the correlation between DTI metrics and $a$ and $\rho$, we pool all values in the CC ROI from all subjects separately for scan and rescan and report the robust correlation coefficient\citep{Huber:1996}. All statistical processing was performed using the software R\citep{RCoreTeam:2012} with packages 'ICC'\citep{Wolak:2011} and 'robust'\citep{Wang:2012}.

\subsection{SC experiment}
\subsubsection*{Data acquisition}
We performed the scans  our \SFasym{} in one healthy volunteers (41YO female). The \SF{} DWI protocol wasacquired with following scan parameters: voxel size: 1x1x5mm3, FOV=64x64mm$^2$, cardiac gated, TR=5RR, using the outer-volume suppressed ZOOM acquisition \citep{Wilm:2007} as in the CC. We chose the 32-channel head coil to perform the scans as we found that it offers superior SNR in the cervical cord region than the dedicated 16-channel head-neck coil alternative.Scan were acquired between the discs C1/2 and C3/4, although severe motion artifacts made it necessary to exclude all slices except the 3 most caudal slices.

\section{Results}
\subsection*{Axon diameter and axon density indices in the CC}
Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 scan rescan maps per subject} shows side-by-side scan/rescan maps of $a$ and $\rho$ for all five subjects. Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 scan rescan scatterplots per subject} summarizes the mean $a$ and $\rho$ parameters measured in each ROI for all five subjects. In all subjects we can clearly see the variation along AP we expect from previous experiment and earlier studies \citep{Alexander:2010}. Furthermore, in comparison with those earlier results, our maps appear considerably less noisy and show improved contrast between different CC regions. Consistent with our previous results, we estimate values of $a$ in the range of 5--15$\mu m$. The largest $a$ estimates are found in the midbody of the CC. The smallest $a$ values are found in the splenium <8$\mu m$ and the anterior part of the genu (9--11$\mu m$). The axon density index $\rho$ is reciprocal to the $a$ trends, with $\rho$ being largest in the anterior genu and posterior splenium regions and smallest in the body and isthmus of the CC. The $a$ and $\rho$ pattern we observe here agrees very well with the microstructure that is seen in excised human CC tissue samples.


Unlike in the previous experiments, the high spatial resolution here provides a large number of voxels that are completely contained in the CC. As a consequence, the CC can be easily distinguished from surrounding tissue and the tissue parameter estimates are less influenced by CSF contamination, particularly in the thinning part of the CC (B3--S1). This is beneficial for subjects with smaller CC such as found in s2 \& s3, but becomes even more important in view of future applications in patients with neurological diseases such as MS or Alzheimers disease, who often suffer from severe CC atrophy.

\end{figure}

\subsection*{Inter- \& Intra-subject reproducibility}
Results in Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 scan rescan maps per subject} and  Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 scan rescan scatterplots per subject} suggest good ROI-wise consistency of the parameter maps between the five subjects. Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 scan rescan averages}, also shows that the average taken over all 5 subjects for the scan and rescan experiment agree very well with each other, both in the average trend as well as in the observed standard deviation. Moreover, both $a$ and $\rho$ show very little variation from the mean over all subjects. Inter-subject variation is lower in the mid-body and the proximal genu regions (G2--G3) than in the more distal anterior and posterior regions. The Bland-Altman plots shown in Figure \ref{fig:chap9 bland altman plot} show good scan/rescan variation independent of parameter estimate with the majority of ROI estimates within the confidence interval of 1.5 standard deviations. In a minority of ROIs we see outliers with scan/rescan large variation. This appears to be related to large axon density estimates, which appear more unstable than smaller $\rho$ values. Those outliers appear mostly in the most distal G1 and S3 regions. Such large variations might indicate cardiac pulsation artifacts as these regions are closest to the adjacent Arteria Cerebralis. In $a$ the scan/rescan variability appears more independent of the actual estimation values.


Table~\ref{tab:chapter9 ICC table} presents the \gls{ICC} for whole CC and individual ROIs. For both $a$ and $\rho$, we find the scan/rescan agreement being 'moderate' or better for both whole CC values and most ROIs. As noted before, the lowest ICC values are found in boundary regions (G1) or in the thin proximal part of the CC, which are most affected by imaging and analysis artefacts. Both Bland-Altman analysis as well as the ICC suggest that estimated values in those ROIs appear more prone to error and must be interpreted with caution.

	\label{fig:chap 9 DTI correlations}	
\end{figure}	
Figure~\ref{fig:chap 9 DTI correlations} presents the correlation between the standard DTI metrics and the $a$ and $\rho$ estimates. The correlations we see here agree with the findings of \citep{Barazany:2009} and \citep{Alexander:2010}. Correlation are found between $FA$ and both microstructure indices of $a$ and $\rho$. While $MD$ is not correlated either of the microstructure indices, the directional diffusivities $AD$ and $RD$ both show moderate correlations with $a$ and $\rho$. Of course it is not surprising to find $RD$ negatively correlated with $a$ and positively correlated with $\rho$ respectively, as it is know both axonal packing density, and axon diameter all influence $RD$ measurements \citep{Beaulieu:2002}. The observed correlation between $AD$ and $a$ (positive) and $\rho$ (negative) is less intuitively explainable, however consistent with previous findings \citep{Barazany:2009,Alexander:2010}. Alexander et al. speculate that the increase of axon size and decrease of packing density are associated with lower fibre coherency, and thus are causing an increasing amount of diffusion impedance along the dominant diffusion direction. The correlation between AD and the $a$ and $\rho$ indices might also be the result of residual CSF contamination, since the regions high axon diameter are mostly found in the thinner midbody region which might be more affected by partial volume effects coming from motion or eddy-current distortions than those in the larger genu and splenium regions.

\subsection*{Axon diameter and axon density indices in the SC}
Figure~\ref{fig:chap 9 SC results} shows the $a$ and $\rho$ maps acquired in one healthy volunteer. Gray matter areas are excluded here as they are clearly violating the single fibre assumption of our method.  We clearly see the bilateral symmetry of the parameter maps as expected from the basic anatomy of the spinal cord. The estimates of $a$ and $\rho$ indices are within a similar range of values measured in the CC. Furthermore, both $a$ and $\rho$ allow good discrimination between motor and sensory WM tracts. The largest $a$ (10.7 $\pm$ 2$\mu m$) and lowest $\rho$ (0.035$\pm$0.017$\mu m^{-2}$) are found in the lateral tract. The dorsal sensory tract shows the lowest $a$ (9.1$\pm$1.3$\mu m$) and highest $\rho$ (0.046$\pm$0.017$\mu m^{-2}$). The contrast between LT and DC is consistent over several slices in our dataset and agrees with our earlier findings in fixed monkey cervical cord. Figure~\ref{fig:chap 9 SC results} also illustrates well the challenges in SC imaging. The posterior halo of low $a$ is the result of motion artifacts during the acquisition which can be cause e.g. by swallowing or breathing. Cardiac motion also makes cardiac gating a neccesity, which in turn reduces the data we can acquire within the 25 minute windows and consequently reduced the SNR in our data. However, the results here show first evidence that our \SFasym{} protocol can be used successfully in the SC application, despite the more challenging imaging environment.

\section{Discussion}
This work presents a novel imaging and analysis pipeline for measuring axon diameter and density indices in the CC in-vivo, which expands on our \SFasym{} protocol optimisation we introduced in the previous chapter. We combined small FOV imaging and careful optimisation of the MR protocols and post-processing techniques to gain both high spatial resolution while maximising SNR. We show here axon diameter and axon density maps of better quality than previous studies have shown before. For the first time we present results of a larger subject cohort of 5 subjects, allowing to infer scan and rescan reproducibilty with more confidence. Our results show that $a$ and $\rho$ show very good reproducibility consistently over all investigated subjects. Furthermore, a first test of our protocol in healthy cervical cord in-vivo in humans produced compelling results that are in good agreement with our findings excised monkey cervical cord.

\subsection*{Limitations \& further work}
\paragraph{Interpretation of $a$ and $\rho$}The model we use here is a very simplistic approximation of the complex micro-anatomy of real biological tissue. The actual estimates of axon diameter and densities differ considerably from what is expected from histology or ex-vivo scans \citep{Alexander:2010}, which show much more prevalence of small calibre axons (1-3$\mu m$) in the corpus callosum. Most of this disparity can be explained by the limited gradient strength available on clinical system.  With limited gradient strength, small axons cause very little signal attenuation and become indistinguishable from each other \citep{Laett:2007,Yeh:2010}. Our simulation experiments in Chapter \ref{XX} show a limit of sensitivity of of 2--4$\mu m$ even in the very idealised situation of perfectly aligned single-radius cylinders. Consequently, the $a$ and $\rho$ indices must not be seen as accurate reflections of the complete axon diameter distribution as they are likely driven only by a small number of large axons in the WM. 

Other more complex models have been also been suggested, adding more tissue compartments, a distribution of axon diameters and/or permeable membranes. However, with the given limits both in scan time and gradient hardware, their practical value for in-vivo clinical applications is questionable. Recent studies e.g. by \citet{Panagiotaki:2012, Ferizi:2012} have studied those more complex models in the CC WM tissue with much more extensive datasets than we used here. Their findings suggest that a simple two compartment model similar to ours explains diffusion in coherent WM tissue reasonably well. For our purpose of clinical adoption, this model provides the best trade-off between explaining the diffusion in WM while keeping data requirements reasonably low. Furthermore, the shorter protocol we propose is an important step to enable more widespread adaptation of our imaging pipeline, which in turn will lead to a better understanding of its parameters interpretation.


Furthermore, alternative acquisition methods such as oscillating gradients \citep{Does:2003, Colvin:2008} or multiple wave-vector acquisitions \citep{Komlosh:2008,Koch:2008,Avram:2012} promise more sensitivity to smaller axon diameters. Recently the protocol optimisation framework has been extended to support such non-rectangular gradient waveforms\citet{Drobnjak:2010,Siow:2012a}. The method we present here is seasily combined with any other pulse sequences to provide better discrimination of small axon diameters.

\paragraph{T2 estimation: } We chose here to estimate T2 directly from the b=0 weighted images. Using this approach, we are limited to estimate rather high \glspl{TE} due to the nature of the single shot EPI technique used here. Furthermore, due to the sparsity of the \glspl{TE} samples, we can only account for mono-exponential T2-decay. A more comprehensive T2 decay curve could potentially be estimated using the \gls{CPMG} sequence \citep{Pell:2006}. However, this approach would add significant scan time to our protocol. Furthermore, such acquisition does not suffer from the same image distortions as the EPI DWI images and therefore requires further registration, which might confound the results. Nevertheless, a better T2 decay curve estimate might also be used to correct for T2 differences between intra- and extra-axonal compartments. Fitting a single T2 to all compartments could lead to errors in  the $f_{intra}$ estimates and might have an effect on our $\rho$ parameter maps. While we focussed on a single-compartment T2 estimation that to simply fitting, our tissue model can easily incorporate different T2s for individual compartments. 

\paragraph{Validation: } We have validated our result here by comparison with previous reports of tissue parameter estimates by diffusion MRI and independent histopathology. While several systematic reports of the tissue microstructure are available in the CC, validation of our results is more complicated in the SC as it is much less documented. Future work is required to provide a direct comparison between our MRI parameters and independent histology for a better interpretation of our estimated parameters in healthy tissue but more importantly also in the presence of pathological tissue alteration. Following up on our work on \SFasym{}, we are now in the process of setting a validation study of our protocol using post-mortem human spinal cord of healthy and MS tissue in collaboration with Dr DeLuca from the Nuffield Department of Neurosciences, University of Oxford.

\paragraph{Clinical application: } The protocols we present here are designed with clinical adaptation in mind. Due ot the short acquisition time, our 25 minute protocol can be easily incorporated into existing studies. A disadvantage of our method is that it does not offer whole brain coverage. However, the alternative \OI{} method is also intrinsically limiting by the tissue model to application in highly coherent WM structures. In fact, if only such structures are to be studies anyway, our method provides much better spatial resolution, SNR in shorter acquisition time. Furthermore, many neurological diseases such as Alzheimers disease, Schizophrenia or MS have severe impact on the CC and diagnosis. In those diseases, diagnosis and therapy monitoring might benefit from better tissue characterisation. Furthermore, the first results in the SC we showed also promise future application in the cord, e.g. to gain better biomarkers for diagnosis and therapeutic outcome in SCI. Wider application in other parts in the CNS might come from the more complex tissue models which incorporate fibre dispersion and fibre crossing \cite{Zhang:2011}.

\section{Conclusion}
We have demonstrated that our microstructure estimates agree with reported post-mortem evaluation of the CC fibre density distribution. Further, we showed good inter- and intra-subject reproducibility. The scan time of the protocol is short enough to be easily incorporated into clinical studies. In future work, we are planning to use this approach in subjects with known altered microstructure of the CC.
