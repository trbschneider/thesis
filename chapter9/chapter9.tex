\chapter[Scan/rescan in the corpus callosum]{Scan/rescan reproducibility in the corpus callosum and spinal cord}
\section{Introduction}
In the previous chapter we have presented a clinical {\SF} ActiveAx protocols that can be acquired in under 25 minutes scan time. The main motivation for the previous study was to compare our short {\SF} protocol with the 1h long \OI{} protocol of \citep{Alexander:2010}. We found that our \SF{} protocols are quite capable of achieving comparable results to the \OI{} method with only a quarter of acquisitions needed. While we focussed our work on the optimisation of the gradient scheme, we left the imaging setup unchanged from the original \OI{} approach. However, our results suggest that a careful optimisation of all imaging parameters, such as accurate positioning and image resolution and quality have a key role in achieving acceptable and reproducible estimates of tissue microstructure parameters. 


We therefore present here an new imaging pipeline, which improves on the following key areas study setup from the previous setup: (i) we use of a small \gls{FOV} imaging sequence to increase both image resolution and SNR (ii) be better method to align the image volume with the dominant fibre direction of the CC using fast DTI tractography directly on the scanner console (iii) a further improved \SF{} optimisation algorithm and tissue model to allow the shortest \gls{TE} for individual diffusion acquisitions to improve SNR in low diffusion weighted scans.  We test our approach in 5 healthy volunteers, who were scanned at two different timepoint to assess both intra- and inter-subject reproducibility. 


\section{Methods \& Experiments}
\subsection*{Protocol optimisation}
We use here a slightly modified version of the \SFasym{} optimisation, which we described detail in Section~\ref{XX} of the previous chapter. We adapt the tissue model to include an additional T2 decay factor that accounts for signal loss in the DWI with respect to the \gls{TE}. For simplicity, we assume here a mono-exponential T2 decay of the signal. Previously, the \gls{TE} was governed by the maximum TE in the whole protocol. This modification now allows the use of dynamic \glspl{TE} for different PGSE parameters in the protocol optimisation. This has the advantage of effectively reducing the \gls{TE} in the low DWI acquisition, which improves the SNR in those acquisitions.



We carry out the optimisation using as before, assuming a T2 decay factor of 70ms typical for white matter (WM) in the CC \cite{cite stanisz relaxation times paper}. We further increase the maximum usable gradient strength to 87mT/m, by combining the perpendicular 62mT/m gradients using our modified scanner firmware (as implemented earlier see \ref{XX}). We further add a single shell DTI acquisition (max b=800s/mm2, 1 b=0, 16 uniformly distributed directions) to our protocols to improve fitting. The full protocol is given in Table \ref{tab:chap9 protocol table}.

\subsection*{Data acquisition}
We recruited 5 healthy volunteers (3 female, 2 male, mean age=XX +/- YY) to be scanned on a Philips Achieva 3TX scanner. All subjects were recalled for a second scan on adifferent day days to assess the intra-subject reproducibility of the experiment. In each scan session we acquire a the optimised \SF{} DWI protocol with following scan parameters: voxel size: 1x1x4mm3, FOV=96x96mm2, TR=6000ms, 2 averages, using an outer-volume suppressed ZOOM acquisition [6] to avoid fold-over artifacts.  
\paragraph{}
The previous experiments have shown that our \SF{} methods benefit from accurate alignment of the gradient scheme with respect to the dominant fibre direction. While standard T2w localizers is adequate to align the scan volume to anatomical reference, it offers no information about the WM fibre orientation. To aid slice positioning, we acquire a fast DTI scan in addition to the conventional scout scans. The scout-DTI imaging parameters are as follows: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXx. We use the PRIDE tools directly on the scan console to place a ROI in the mid-sagittal slice of the CC and perform FACT tractography on the DTI dataset (FA threshold=0.45, angle threshold=YY). The tracts are then overlayed on the colour-coded FA map, rasterised, and resliced to obtain a new 1x1x1 image volume. We use the axial and coronal views of the tractography results to adjust the angulation of the \SF{} image volume with respect to the observed tracts.  Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 FOV positioning} shows an example of the final slice alignment based on both the structural localizer scan and tractography results. Since the whole scout-DTI processing is performed on the scanner console, the additional scan setup time by acquiring analysing the scout-DTI scan is kept to a minimum.

\end{figure}
\subsection*{Post-processing}
We compensate for motion during the acquisition by aligning all scan volumes to the first b=0 image using the block-wise rigid registration algorithm \citep{XX} implemented in \citep{niftyreg}. However, since the diffusion weighted images provide little contrast in non-coherently aligned WM tissue, we only register the interleaved b=0 images and apply the estimated transformation matrix to the subsequent intermediate b>0 images.   

To ensure anatomical correspondence between scan and rescan, we then register the rescan dataset to the scan dataset (using rigid registration) using the transformation estimates from registering  the first b=0 images of the two datasets. The transformation matrices for intra-scan motion and scan/rescan alignment are combined before applying them to the dataset to avoid unnecessary multiple interpolations. The data is then smoothed using the Unbiased Non-Local Means filter \citep{Aja-Fernandez:2010} with a filter radius of $3x3x1$.

\subsection*{Data analysis}
We use the same fitting procedure as outlined in the previous chapters. However since we allowed for variable TE in each acquisition, we need to account for the resulting differences in T2 single decay within the data. We therefore estimate the voxel-wise mono-exponential decay curve using a linear regression model based on the non-diffusion-weighted acquisitions. The predicted MR signal $S$ from the tissue model is then adjusted based on its \glspl{TE} by:
\begin{equation}
	S' = S * exp(TE/T2).
\end{equation}
The adjusted signal S' is then used to compute the rician log-likelihood with the observed signal as previously. We computed the posterior distributions of the model parameters using an MCMC method on a voxel-by-voxel basis. From the mean of the posterior distribution we compute the the axon diameter index $a$ and axonal density index $\rho$=f/$\pi/a^2$. In addition we also fitted the diffusion tensor to the 16-direction DTI data and derive the principal eigenvectors $v1$--$v3$ and scalar maps of FA, MD, AD, RD. The fitting routine is implemented using the open-source Camino toolkit \citep{Cook:2006}.
\subsection*{ROI analysis} In each subject we manually segmented roughly the CC on the mid-sagittal slice. We then remove all voxels from the CC mask with FA<0.5 appear to exclude voxels with more than one single fibre orientation or significant CSF contamination from the analysis. We further exclude voxel where v1 deviated more than 10 degrees from the left-right fibre orientation we assumed in the protocol optimisation. The CC segmentation is then divided in 10 equidistant regions along the anterior-posterior baseline similar to \cite{Aboitiz}. Figure \ref{XX} shows an example of the CC subdivision in one subject. Mean $a$ and $\rho$ indices are then computed for each CC subdivision in each of the 10 datasets. Scan/rescan agreement is assessed visually as well as it is quantified by computing the \gls{ICC} \citep{Shrout:1979} over the whole CC and in each \gls{ROI}. To investigate the correlation between DTI metrics and $a$ and $\rho$, we pool all values in the CC ROI of all subjects separately for scan and rescan and report the robust correlation coefficient \citep{XX}. All statistical processing was performed using the software R\citep{RCoreTeam:2012} with packages 'ICC'\citep{Wolak:2011} and 'robust'\citep{Wang:2012}.

\section{Results}
\subsection*{Axon diameter and axon density indices}
Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 scan rescan maps per subject} shows side-by-side scan/rescan maps of $a$ and $\rho$ for all five subjects. Figure~\ref{fig:chap9 scan rescan scatterplots per subject} summarizes the mean $a$ and $\rho$ parameters measured in each ROI for all five subjects. In all subjects we can clearly see the variation along AP we expect from previous experiment and earlier studies \citep{Alexander:2010}. Furthermore, in comparison with those earlier results, our maps appear considerably less noisy and show improved contrast between different CC regions. Consistent with our previous results, we estimate values of $a$ in the range of 5--15$\mu m$. The largest $a$ estimates are found in the midbody of the CC. The smallest $a$ values are found in the splenium <8$\mu m$ and the anterior part of the genu (9--11$\mu m$). The axon density index $\rho$ is reciprocal to the $a$ trends, with $\rho$ being largest in the anterior genu and posterior splenium regions  (XX--XY) and smallest in the body and isthmus of the CC. Axons too large!! The $a$ and $\rho$ pattern we observe here agrees very well with the microstructure that is seen in excised human CC tissue samples ().


Unlike in the previous experiments, the high spatial resolution here provides a large number of voxels that are completely contained in the CC. As a consequence, the CC can be easily distinguished from surrounding tissue and the tissue parameter estimates are less influenced by CSF contamination, particularly in the thinning part of the CC (B3--S1). This is beneficial for subjects with smaller CC such as found in s2 \& s3, but becomes even more important in view of future applications in patients with neurological diseases such as MS or Alzheimers disease, who often suffer from severe CC atrophy.

\subsection*{Inter- \& Intra-subject reproducibility}
A simple visual comparision of scan and rescan maps suggest that ROI-wise microstructure estimates are very consistent between the five subjects. As shown in Figure~\ref{}, the average results over all 5 subjects are very similar between scan and rescan experiment, both in the average trend as well as in the observed standard deviation. Moreover, both $a$ and $\rho$ show very little variation from the mean over all subjects. Inter-subject variation is lower in the mid-body and the proximal genu regions (G2--G3) than in the more distal anterior and posterior regions. The Bland-Altman plots shown in Figure \ref{fig:chapter9 bland altman} show good scan/rescan variation independent of parameter estimate with the majority of ROI estimates within the 95\% confidence interval. Few ROI outliers which exhibit rather scan/rescan large variation. Scan/rescan variation appears unsystematic in $a$. However in $\rho$, the large axon density estimates appear more unstable than smaller $\rho$ values. Outliers appear mostly in the most distal G1 and S3 regions. Such large variations might indicate cardiac pulsation artifacts as these regions are closest to the adjacent Arteria Cerebralis. 


Table~\ref{tab:XXX} presents the ICC values \gls{ICC} for whole CC and individual ROIs. For both $a$ and $\rho$, we find the scan/rescan agreement being 'moderate' or better for both whole CC values and most ROIs. As noted before, the lowest ICC values are found in boundary regions (G1) or in the thin proximal part of the CC, which are most affected by imaging and analysis artefacts. Both Bland-Altman analysis as well as the ICC suggests that estimated values in those ROIs appear more prone to error and must be interpreted with caution.

	\label{fig:chap 9 DTI correlations}	
\end{figure}	
Figure~\ref{fig:chap 9 DTI correlations} presents the correlation between the standard DTI metrics and the $a$ and $\rho$ estimates. The correlations we see here agree with the findings of \citep{Barazany:2009} and \citep{Alexander:2010}. While $MD$ is not correlated either of the microstructure indices, the directional diffusivities $AD$ and $RD$ both show moderate correlations with $a$ and $\rho$. Of course it is not surprising to find $RD$ negatively correlated with $a$ and positively correlated with $\rho$ respectively, as it is know both axonal packing density, and axon diameter all influence $RD$ measurements \citep{Beaulieu:2002}. The observed correlation between $AD$ and $a$ (positive) and $\rho$ (negative) is less intuitively explainable, however consistent with previous findings \citep{Barazany:2009,Alexander:2010}. Alexander et al. speculate that the increase of axon size and decrease of packing density are associated with lower fibre coherency, and thus are causing an increasing amount of diffusion impedance along the dominant diffusion direction. The correlation between AD and the $a$ and $\rho$ indices might also be the result of varying CSF contamination, since the regions high axon diameter are mostly found in the thinner midbody region are more affected by partial volume effects than those in genu and splenium. Since we find both $AD$ and $RD$ correlated with the $a$ and $\rho$ indices, their correlation with $FA$ follows by definition.

\section{Discussion}
This work presents a novel imaging and analysis pipeline for measuring axon diameter and density indices in the CC in-vivo, which expands on our \SFasym{} protocol optimisation we introduced in the previous chapter. We combined small FOV imaging and careful optimisation of the MR protocols and post-processing techniques to gain both high spatial resolution while maximising SNR. We show here axon diameter and axon density maps of better quality than previous studies have shown before. For the first time present results of a larger subject cohort of 5 subjects, allowing to infer scan and rescan reproducibilty with more confidence. Our results show that $a$ and $\rho$ show very good reproducibility consistently over all investigated subjects. 


It must be noted that the while the estimates microstructure indice agree in trend with histopathology studies of the CC \citep{Aboitiz}, our estimates of axon diameter are considerably skewed towards larger axon diameters (and hence lower packing densities) than expected from histology. A likely explanation is that $a$ is more sensitive to larger axon diameters than small ones. Due to the limited gradient strength available on clinical system, small axons cause very little signal attenuation and become indistinguishable from each other. Even in the idealised simulation experiments with a single fibre diameter we presented in Chapter \ref{XX}, we found that the limit of sensitivity to the fibre radius is in the range of of 2--4$\mu m$. It is therefore very is likely that the contrast we see in the $a$ index is driven mostly by the larger axons in the WM.


Several other confounding also potentially can impact the microstructure parameter we estimate:

The model fitting procedure fixes the diffusivity parameters to biologically plausible values, which stabilizes the fitting procedure and hastens convergence. The precise setting of the diffusivity parameters does not affect the trends in the parameter maps a great deal, although it does affect the absolute values of a′ and ρ. The fixed diffusivities we use approximate the mean D|| from the lowest b-value HARDI shell in regions of coherent white matter and CSF. The fixed settings of dI also approximate the diffusivity of water at body (in vivo) and room (postmortem) temperature. Moreover, the fixed settings are very close to those that give minimum average fitting errors over the set of processed voxels, which supports the choices. However, since d∥ is fixed, trends in the true diffusivity could cause the trends we observe in a′ and ρ. Indeed, allowing the diffusivity to vary during fitting does produce trends in d∥′ in the corpus callosum similar to those in a′ and ρ and weakens (but does not remove) the trends in a′ and ρ. However, simulations (not shown) show correlation between d∥′ and a′ even when the true d∥ used in the simulation does not vary and that stable estimates of a require fixing d∥. Barazany et al. (2009) also fix d∥. It seems unlikely that the substructure of white matter varies enough among different regions to cause significant differences in d∥.


In summary, we use a simple model to obtain measurements from a clearly more complex system. The agreement with independent measurements from histology is compelling. However, as with all model-based techniques, we must acknowledge that effects other than those we model might influence the trends we observe. The promising results we obtain here, however, motivate further simulation and validation experiments to confirm their source and test the influence of the effects above.

The indices may also prove useful markers for specific diseases. In particular, multiple sclerosis attacks small axons preferentially (De Luca et al., 2004) and motor–neurone disease preferentially attacks large axons (Cluskey and Ramsden, 2001). Highley et al. (1999) show significant differences in fibre composition in the corpus callosum, assessed by postmortem histology, between healthy subjects and certain groups of patients with schizophrenia. Other diseases and disorders may also have characteristic microstructural abnormalities.

\subsection*{Further work}
The results prompt many areas of further work at each stage of the methodological pipeline.

Modelling
The white matter model is appealing for its simplicity and we purposefully include the minimum number of components required to capture the main trends in the measured data. However, minor departures of the signals from the models are visible in Fig. 10 and Fig. 13 and some benefits may come from increasing complexity to capture more effects.

The model might use a better tortuosity estimator (Fiermans et al., 2008) and predict the signal better with finite δ (Codd and Callaghan, 1999), but since the model is crude anyway, we may see little improvement in the final result from these minor refinements. We might include a distribution of axon diameters, as in Assaf et al. (2008), to increase sensitivity to smaller axons and provide a more complete description of the diameter distribution. Preliminary experiments (not shown) with our sparse data sets, however, fail to recover consistent estimates of the parameters of a gamma distribution on a. Single-parameter distribution models, such as Poisson, may prove useful.

An important difference we observe between the in vivo and postmortem data is the apparent restriction in the parallel direction, which we only observe in the fixed tissue. Here we use the simplest possible model to capture the effect in the postmortem data. Future work will examine the effect more closely and compare models that explain the effect in different ways more thoroughly.

The most significant limitation of the current model is the requirement for a tight distribution of axon orientations, since white matter fibres in the brain form a variety of complex configurations. One possibility is to keep the current model, but interpret a′ instead as a feature of the diameter distribution perpendicular to the mean fibre direction. However, more useful indices may come from models that account for nontrivial distributions of fibre orientations. Various techniques estimate complex subvoxel distributions of fibre orientations; see Seunarine and Alexander (2009) for a review. These techniques currently use only simple models of diffusion in fibres, but extend naturally to include axon diameter parameters, which may provide the key to relaxing the constraint on fibre orientation distribution.

The current model also assumes impermeable axon walls. The assumption is reasonable for myelinated axons over the timescales of the measurements we make (Stanisz et al., 1997). However, some white matter structures contain higher densities of unmyelinated axons than the CST or corpus callosum. Lack of myelin increases permeability and models may need to incorporate exchange for accurate parameter estimates in such tracts. Permeability and density of unmyelinated axons would be useful measurements in themselves if they prove possible to estimate.


The a priori model parameter settings in the optimization affect the optimized protocol and the precision and accuracy of parameter estimates. More informed choices of a priori settings may improve the sensitivity of the axon diameter and density indices to differences in fibre composition. For a particular experimental set up, the available gradient strength, free diffusivity and T2 determine the range of diameters for which sensitivity is feasible (Alexander, 2008). The choices of a priori diameters for both protocol optimizations here were chosen to cover that range. In fact, the optimized protocol is fairly insensitive to the number and specific values of a priori diameters so long as they are all within that range. The optimization becomes unstable when the a priori set includes diameters outside the range because the Cramer–Rao lower bound becomes much larger. The settings in the optimization of the human protocol represent only the largest axons. In fact, the 40-μm setting is unrealistically large, and its inclusion, which is mainly for consistency with earlier work (Alexander, 2008), does affect the optimized protocol. In simulation, however, it has only a minor effect on the indices. Further work can certainly refine the choice of a priori settings, although we do not expect this alone to produce dramatic improvements.


More significant improvements may come from replacing the standard PGSE sequence with other diffusion-sensitive sequences, such as oscillating gradient ( [Callaghan and Stepisnik, 1995] and [Does et al., 2003]) or double wave-vector ( [Komlosh et al., 2008], [Koch and Finsterbusch, 2008] and [Ozarslan and Basser, 2007]) experiments, which may be more sensitive to microstructural parameters. Stimulated echo sequences (Merboldt et al., 1991) enable longer diffusion times, which should provide better sensitivity to larger axon diameters in the post-mortem protocol. The experiment design optimization extends naturally to protocols using other pulse sequences. For example, Clayden et al. (2009) demonstrate the technique for the dual spin-echo sequence (Reese et al., 2003), which reduces Eddy-current effects compared to PGSE in vivo and may enhance sensitivity slightly. Combination of the experiment design with these other pulse sequences should allow the a priori range of axon diameters to extend to include smaller diameters. This should provide protocols with sensitivity to wider ranges and provide more discriminative axon diameter indices.


Validation
We limit validation here to simulations and comparison with sparse histology data in the literature. More direct comparison with histology is possible with our fixed monkey brains, which will be revealing particularly outside the CST and midsagittal corpus callosum. However, we plan further imaging studies before sectioning these valuable samples.


We have demonstrated that our microstructure estimates agree with reported post-mortem evaluation of the CC fibre density distribution. Further, we showed good inter- and intra-subject reproducibility. The scan time of the protocol is short enough to be easily incorporated into clinical studies. In future work, we are planning to use this approach in subjects with known altered microstructure of the CC.
