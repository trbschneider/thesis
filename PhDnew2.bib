	in the gross morphometry of the human corpus callosum. However, no
	studies exist on individual differences in the fiber composition
	of the corpus callosum. Here we report for the first time the relation
	of fiber composition in specific callosal segments (as seen in light
	microscopy) to anatomical asymmetries in language-gifted cortex,
	as a function of sex. We found a significant negative correlation
	between Sylvian fissure asymmetries and the total numbers of fibers
	in the isthmus of males, and in the anterior splenium of females.
	In addition, a population of relatively large fibers (between 1 micron
	and 3 microns in diameter) in the isthmus showed a strong negative
	correlation with perisylvian asymmetries only in males. These findings
	suggest a sex-dependent, pathway-specific decrease in interhemispheric
	connectivity with increasing lateralization.},

  abstract = {The diffusion tensor is currently the accepted model of diffusion
	in biological tissues. The measured diffusion behavior may be more
	complex when two or more distinct tissues with different diffusion
	tensors occupy the same voxel. In this study, a partial volume model
	of {MRI} signal behavior for two diffusion-tensor compartments is
	presented. Simulations using this model demonstrate that the conventional
	single diffusion tensor model could lead to highly variable and inaccurate
	measurements of diffusion behavior. The differences between the single
	and two-tensor models depend on the orientations, fractions, and
	exchange between the two diffusion tensor compartments, as well as
	the diffusion-tensor encoding technique and diffusion-weighting that
	is used in the measurements. The current single compartment model's
	inaccuracies could cause diffusion-based characterization of cerebral
	ischemia and white matter connectivity to be incorrect. A diffusion-tensor
	{MRI} imaging experiment on a normal human brain revealed significant
	partial volume effects between oblique white matter regions when
	using very large voxels and large diffusion-weighting (b approximately
	2.69 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)). However, the apparent partial volume effects
	in white matter decreased significantly when smaller voxel dimensions
	were used. For diffusion tensor studies obtained using typical diffusion-weighting
	values (b approximately 1 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)) partial volume effects
	are much more difficult to detect and resolve. More accurate measurements
	of multiple diffusion compartments may lead to improved confidence
	in diffusion measurements for clinical applications.},

	for ensembles of long cylinders having a diameter of 9 and 20\&\#xa0;√é¬ºm.
	It was found that the diffraction patterns are sensitive to the rotational

	perpendicular to the long axis of the cylinders i.e., when √é¬±=90√Ç¬∞√Ç¬±5√Ç¬∞
	under our experimental conditions. More importantly, we also found
	that the structural information extracted from the displacement distribution
	profiles and from the diffraction patterns are very similar and in
	good agreement with the experimental values for cylinders of 20\&\#xa0;√é¬ºm
	or even 9\&\#xa0;√é¬ºm, when data is acquired with parameters that
	satisfy the short gradient pulse {(SGP)} approximation (i.e., √é¬¥√¢‚Ä†‚Äô0)
	and the long diffusion time limit. Since these experimental conditions
	are hardly met in in vitro diffusion {MRI} of excised organs, and
	cannot be met in clinical {MRI} scanners, we evaluated the effect
	of the pulse gradient duration and the diffusion time on the structural
	information extracted from q-space diffusion {MR} experiments. Indeed
	it was found that, as expected, accurate structural information,
	and diffraction patterns are observed when √é‚Äù is large enough
	so that the spins reach the cylinders√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ boundaries. In addition,
	it was found that large √é¬¥ results in extraction of a compartment

	on experimental parameters used to collect the {MR} data. {q-Space}
	diffusion {MR} performed on clinical scanners is generally collected
	with relatively long diffusion gradient pulses, in which the gradient
	pulse duration, delta, is comparable to the diffusion time, Delta.
	In this study, we used phantoms, consisting of ensembles of microtubes,
	and mathematical models to assess the effect of the ratio of the
	diffusion time and the duration of the diffusion pulse gradient,
	i.e., Delta/delta, on the {MR} signal attenuation vs. q, and on the
	measured structural information extracted therefrom. We found that
	for Delta/delta approximately 1, the diffraction pattern obtained
	from q-space {MR} data are shallower than when the short gradient
	pulse {(SGP)} approximation is satisfied. For long delta the estimated
	compartment size is, as expected, smaller than the real size. Interestingly,
	for Delta/delta approximately 1 the diffraction peaks are shifted
	to even higher q-values, even when delta is kept constant, giving
	the impression that the restricted compartments are even smaller
	than they are. When phantoms composed of microtubes of different
	diameters are used, it is more difficult to estimate the diameter
	distribution in this regime. Excellent agreement is found between
	the experimental results and simulations that explicitly account
	for the use of long duration gradient pulses. Using such experimental
	data and this mathematical framework, one can estimate the true compartment
	dimensions when long and finite gradient pulses are used even when
	Delta/delta approximately 1.},

	this increase was significantly smaller than expected from the Einstein
	equation. However, the most restricted component is the slow diffusing
	component of the optic nerve. This is also the only diffusing component
	that shows a large change in the slope (i.e. a 'breaking point')
	of the plot of rmsd as a function of t(d)(1/2). This rmsd is very
	similar to the mean axon size of these optic nerves determined histologically.
	Such a change in slope was less apparent for the slow diffusing component
	of sciatic nerves, which showed a wider distribution of axon size
	in histological images. The fast diffusing components of both nerve
	types showed only a small gradual change in the slope of rmsd plotted
	against t(d)(1/2). These findings are discussed in the context of

	sections with the light microscope. Injuries were produced by a weight-drop
	apparatus, with the vertebral body {(T9)} below the impact stabilized
	by supports under the transverse processes. The effects of two combinations

	an impact area of 5 mm diameter. Animals were kept for 3√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú5
	months after injury, then fixed by perfusion for histological analysis.
	The number of surviving myelinated axons was found to vary both with
	the weight used and with the size of the spinal cord. A measure of
	impact intensity was derived from the calculated momentum of the
	weight at impact divided by the cross sectional area of the cord
	(interpolated from dimensions measured rostral and caudal of the
	lesion following fixation). At impact intensities {\textgreater}
	0.02 kg-m/s/cm2 there was practically no survival of axons at the
	center of the injury site, combined with almost complete breakdown
	of the pial margin. Between 0.08 and 0.2 kg-m/s/cm2 the number of
	surviving axons varied between 100,000 and 2000, approximating a
	negative exponential function (r = √¢ÀÜ‚Äô0.88). The number of axons
	surviving in the outer 100 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m of the cord varied
	practically linearly (r = √¢ÀÜ‚Äô0.82) between near normal and {\textless}
	1\% of normal over the same range of injury intensity. The number
	of surviving axons decreased with depth from the pia, also approximating
	a negative exponential function, with a 10-fold decrease in density
	over approximately 500 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m. The average slope
	of this relation with depth remained similar over the range of injury
	intensity examined, though the slope appeared inversely related to
	variation in axonal survival for different individuals at a given
	intensity. It is argued that the loss of axons is probably determined
	primarily by mechanical stretch at the time of impact. Its centrifugal
	pattern may be explained by longitudinal displacement of the central
	contents of the cord, reflecting the viscoelastic √¢‚Ç¨≈ìboundary
	layer√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ properties of parenchymal flow within the meningeal
	tube. This is illustrated with reference to the behavior of a gelatin
	model under compression. The preferential loss of large caliber axons
	and the characteristic shift to abnormally thin myelm sheaths (resulting
	from post-traumatic demyelination) both varied in extent independently
	of injury intensity and overall axonal survival. These effects are
	concluded to be the result of independent processes, triggered by
	traumatic injury, apparently delayed in time, but ultimately superimposed
	on the initial mechanical disruption.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that axonal damage, and not demyelination,
	is the primary cause of long-term neurological impairment in multiple
	sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
	{(EAE).} The axial and radial diffusivities derived from diffusion
	tensor imaging have shown promise as non-invasive surrogate markers
	of axonal damage and demyelination, respectively. In this study,
	in vivo diffusion tensor imaging of the spinal cords from mice with
	chronic {EAE} was performed to determine if axial diffusivity correlated
	with neurological disability in {EAE} assessed by the commonly used
	clinical scoring system. Axial diffusivity in the ventrolateral white
	matter showed a significant negative correlation with {EAE} clinical
	score and was significantly lower in mice with severe {EAE} than
	in mice with moderate {EAE.} Furthermore, the greater decreases in
	axial diffusivity were associated with greater amounts of axonal
	damage, as confirmed by quantitative staining for non-phosphorylated
	neurofilaments {(SMI32).} Radial diffusivity and relative anisotropy
	could not distinguish between the groups of mice with moderate {EAE}
	and those with severe {EAE.} The results further the notion that
	axial diffusivity is a non-invasive marker of axonal damage in white

  abstract = {Axotomy of nerve fibers leads to the subsequent degeneration of their
	distal part, a process termed Wallerian degeneration {(WD).} While
	{WD} in the peripheral nervous system is usually followed by regeneration
	of the lesioned axons, central nervous system {(CNS)} neurons are
	generally unable to regrow. In this study, we investigated the process
	of {WD} in the dorsal columns of the rat spinal cord rostral to a
	mid-thoracic lesion. We confirm earlier studies describing a very
	delayed microglial and an early and sustained astroglial reaction
	finally leading to scar formation. Interestingly, we found a differential
	time course in the loss of myelin proteins depending on their location.
	Proteins situated on the periaxonal myelin membrane such as myelin
	associated glycoprotein disappeared early, within a few days after
	lesion, concomitantly with cytoskeletal axonal proteins, whereas
	compact myelin and outer myelin membrane proteins such as {MBP} and
	{Nogo-A} remained for long intervals in the degenerating tracts.
	Two distinct mechanisms are probably responsible for this difference:
	processes of protein destruction emanating from and initially probably
	located in the axon act on a time scale of 1-3 days. In contrast,
	the bulk of myelin destruction is due to phagocytosis known to be
	slow, prolonged, and inefficient in the {CNS.} These results may
	also have implications for future intervention strategies aiming
	at enhancing {CNS} regeneration.},

	contaminate the quantification of white matter anisotropy depicted
	by diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI).} We hypothesized that the {FLAIR}
	technique helps to improve {DTI} white matter tractography in the
	normal adult brain by eliminating {CSF} partial volume {effects.METHODS:}
	Seven healthy adults aged 23√¢‚Ç¨‚Äú37 underwent both conventional
	and {FLAIR} {DTI} at {1.5T.} Each subject was imaged five times.
	Neural fiber tractography was performed with both sequences by using
	two algorithms: a voxel-based method {(EZ-tracing)} with global seed
	points and another based on subvoxel tractography (tensor deflection)
	by using manual encircling of local seed points. Total volume of
	the fibers tracked was compared for the two types of {images.RESULTS:}
	Fiber tracking was substantially most successful on {FLAIR} {DTI}
	near the lateral ventricles and the sulci, where {CSF} partial volume
	effects were likely present. Minor false tracts on {FLAIR} images,
	possibly due to a reduced signal-to-noise ratio, were found in regions
	relatively free of {CSF} contamination; however, they did not affect
	tracking of major periventricular white matter bundles, such as those
	related to the corpus callosum or the corona radiata. When we excluded
	false tracts, the {FLAIR} technique depicted an average of 17\% more
	fibers in volume than conventional {DTI} in the periventricular regions
	{(P} {\textbackslash}textless .0005, paired Student t {test).CONCLUSION:}
	Despite the reduction of signal-to-noise ratio and longer imaging
	times, {FLAIR} improved tractography by eliminating {CSF} partial
	volume effects.},

  abstract = {Characterizing demyelination/degeneration of spinal pathways in traumatic
	spinal cord injured {(SCI)} patients is crucial for assessing the
	prognosis of functional rehabilitation. Novel techniques based on
	diffusion-weighted {(DW)} magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} and
	magnetization transfer {(MT)} imaging provide sensitive and specific
	markers of white matter pathology. In this paper we combined for
	the first time high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging
	{(HARDI)}, {MT} imaging and atrophy measurements to evaluate the
	cervical spinal cord of fourteen {SCI} patients and age-matched controls.
	We used high in-plane resolution to delineate dorsal and ventrolateral
	pathways. Significant differences were detected between patients
	and controls in the normal-appearing white matter for fractional
	anisotropy {(FA}, p{\textless}0.0001), axial diffusivity (p{\textless}0.05),
	radial diffusivity (p{\textless}0.05), generalized fractional anisotropy
	{(GFA}, p{\textless}0.0001), magnetization transfer ratio {(MTR},
	p{\textless}0.0001) and cord area (p{\textless}0.05). No significant
	difference was detected in mean diffusivity (p=0.41), T1-weighted
	(p=0.76) and T2-weighted (p=0.09) signals. {MRI} metrics were remarkably
	well correlated with clinical disability {(Pearson's} correlations,
	{FA:} p{\textless}0.01, {GFA:} p{\textless}0.01, radial diffusivity:
	p=0.01, {MTR:} p=0.04 and atrophy: p{\textless}0.01). Stepwise linear
	regressions showed that measures of {MTR} in the dorsal spinal cord
	predicted the sensory disability whereas measures of {MTR} in the
	ventro-lateral spinal cord predicted the motor disability {(ASIA}
	score). However, diffusion metrics were not specific to the sensorimotor
	scores. Due to the specificity of axial and radial diffusivity and
	{MT} measurements, results suggest the detection of demyelination
	and degeneration in {SCI} patients. Combining {HARDI} with {MT} imaging
	is a promising approach to gain specificity in characterizing spinal
	cord pathways in traumatic injury.},

	difficulties that affect the success of clinical trials have to be
	recognised. First, transection of the spinal cord is commonly applied

	in two to three segments, represents the typical injury mechanism
	in human beings. Second, the quadrupedal organisation of locomotion

	associated with spinal-cord contusion is not addressed in current
	translational studies. This damage has direct implications for rehabilitation
	strategies and functional outcome. Fourth, there is increasing evidence
	for a degradation of neuronal function below the level of the lesion

  abstract = {The impact of traumatic spinal cord injury on structural integrity,
	cortical reorganization and ensuing disability is variable and may
	depend on a dynamic interaction between the severity of local damage
	and the capacity of the brain for plastic reorganization. We investigated
	trauma-induced anatomical changes in the spinal cord and brain, and
	explored their relationship to functional changes in sensorimotor
	cortex. Structural changes were assessed using cross-sectional cord
	area, voxel-based morphometry and voxel-based cortical thickness
	of T1-weighted images in 10 subjects with cervical spinal cord injury
	and 16 controls. Cortical activation in response to right-sided (i)
	handgrip; and (ii) median and tibial nerve stimulation were assessed
	using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Regression analyses
	explored associations between cord area, grey and white matter volume,
	cortical activations and thickness, and disability. Subjects with
	spinal cord injury had impaired upper and lower limb function bilaterally,
	a 30\% reduced cord area, smaller white matter volume in the pyramids
	and left cerebellar peduncle, and smaller grey matter volume and
	cortical thinning in the leg area of the primary motor and sensory
	cortex compared with controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
	revealed increased activation in the left primary motor cortex leg
	area during handgrip and the left primary sensory cortex face area
	during median nerve stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury
	compared with controls, but no increased activation following tibial
	nerve stimulation. A smaller cervical cord area was associated with
	impaired upper limb function and increased activations with handgrip
	and median nerve stimulation, but reduced activations with tibial
	nerve stimulation. Increased sensory deficits were associated with
	increased activations in the left primary sensory cortex face area
	due to median nerve stimulation. In conclusion, spinal cord injury
	leads to cord atrophy, cortical atrophy of primary motor and sensory
	cortex, and cortical reorganization of the sensorimotor system. The
	degree of cortical reorganization is predicted by spinal atrophy
	and is associated with significant disability.},

	{MRI} scans of elderly subjects with and without Alzheimer's disease.
	{WMH} are only weakly and inconsistently associated with cognitive
	decline, which may be explained by heterogeneity of the underlying
	neuropathological substrates. The use of quantitative {MRI} could
	increase specificity for these neuropathological changes. We assessed
	whether post-mortem quantitative {MRI} is able to reflect differences
	in neuropathological correlates of {WMH} in tissue samples obtained
	post-mortem from Alzheimer's disease patients and from non-demented
	{elderly.Thirty-three} formalin-fixed, coronal brain slices from
	11 Alzheimer's disease patients (mean age: 83 √Ç¬± 10 years, eight
	females) and 15 slices from seven non-demented controls (mean age:
	78 √Ç¬± 10 years, four females) with {WMH} were scanned at 1.5 T
	using qualitative (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, {FLAIR)}
	and quantitative {MRI} [diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)} including
	estimation of apparent diffusion coefficient {(ADC)} and fractional
	anisotropy {(FA)}, and T1-relaxation time mapping based on flip-angle
	array). A total of 104 regions of interest were defined on {FLAIR}
	images in {WMH} and normal appearing white matter {(NAWM).} Neuropathological
	examination included (semi-)quantitative assessment of axonal density
	{(Bodian)}, myelin density {(LFB)}, astrogliosis {(GFAP)} and microglial
	activation {(HLA-DR).} Patient groups {(Alzheimer's} disease versus
	controls) and tissue types {(WMH} versus {NAWM)} were compared with
	respect to {QMRI} and neuropathological measures. Overall, Alzheimer's
	disease patients had significantly lower {FA} {(P} {\textbackslash}textless
	0.01) and higher T1-values than controls {(P} = 0.04). {WMH} showed
	lower {FA} {(P} {\textbackslash}textless 0.01) and higher T1-values
	{(P} {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) than {NAWM} in both patient
	groups. A significant interaction between patient group and tissue
	type was found for the T1 measurements, indicating that the difference
	in T1-relaxation time between {NAWM} and {WMH} was larger in Alzheimer's
	disease patients than in non-demented controls. All neuropathological
	measures showed differences between {WMH} and {NAWM}, although the
	difference in microglial activation was specific for Alzheimer's
	disease. Multivariate regression models revealed that in Alzheimer's
	disease, axonal density was an independent determinant of {FA}, whereas
	T1 was independently determined by axonal and myelin density and
	microglial activation. Quantitative {MRI} techniques reveal differences
	in {WMH} between Alzheimer's disease and non-demented elderly, and
	are able to reflect the severity of the neuropathological changes
	involved.},

	signs of post mortal destructions. The periodicity of the lamellae
	is preserved and varies about 17 nm. For quantitative purposes specimens
	were taken at random from regions with an extend of half a mm2 on
	the cross section of the pyramid. On the average 62 lamellae (s =
	5, n = 200) built up 1 micron myelin sheath in the 4 brains. The
	myelin sheath thickness and the inner circumference of the myelin
	sheath are measured. The axon diameter is calculated from the inner
	circumference. We obtained an average number of 66,000 fibres, s
	= 11,000 per mm2. Fibres with a total diameter below 4 microns amount
	to 87.9\%, fibres from 4 to 10 microns to 10.77\%, and larger than
	10 microns to 1.4\%. An axon diameter of about 0.5 micron combined
	with a thickness of the myelin sheath of 0.3 micron was most often
	found in all 4 cases. The fibres showed a broad variation of myelin
	thickness. In a given group of the small axons the thickest myelin
	sheath exceeded 3 to 4 times the value of the thinnest one. The coefficient
	of correlation between axon diameter and myelin sheath thickness
	was calculated as r2 = 0.56. No correspondence exists between frequency
	maxima and the ratio g, axon diameter to total diameter. Below a
	total fibre diameter of 5 microns the ratio g scatters broadly about
	0.6, fibres larger than 5 microns exceed the value of 0.6. From the

	the action potential from fibre size frequency distribution is employed.},

	Only weak correlations were found between {DeltaEDSS} and {DeltaMSFC.}
	Although {DeltaEDSS} showed the strongest correlations with change
	in leg function and weak or no correlation with change in cognitive

  abstract = {The number, types, and distribution of distinct classes of axons and
	glia in four cerebral commissures of the adult rhesus monkey {(Macaca}
	mulatta) were determined using electron microscopic and immunocytochemical
	methods. The two neocortical commissures, the corpus callosum, and
	the anterior commissure contain small but cytologically distinct
	archicortical components: the hippocampal commissure, which lies
	ventral to the splenium of the corpus callosum, and the basal telencephalic
	commissure, which forms a small crescent at the anterior margin of
	the anterior commissure. Each archicortical pathway is delineated
	from the adjacent neocortical commissure by a glial capsule. The
	glia cells that form this border are immunoreactive with antisera
	directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein {(GFAP)} and issue
	long processes that form numerous desmosomal junctions with one another.
	Braids of these glial processes envelop axonal fascicles within the
	archicortical commissures. In contrast, the {GFAP-positive} cells
	of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure are randomly distributed
	cells with relatively short stellate processes that do not form boundaries
	around axon fascicles. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis
	reveals that approximately 60 million axons connect the two cerebral
	hemispheres: the corpus callosum contains 56.0 million +/- 3.8 million
	axons (n = 8), the anterior commissure contains 3.15 million +/-
	0.24 million axons (n = 8), the hippocampal commissure has 237,000
	axons +/- 31,000 (n = 6), and the basal telencephalic commissure
	has 193,000 axons +/- 28,000 (n = 5). The number of axons is not
	directly proportional to the cross-sectional area in any of the commissures
	because of variation in axonal composition. On the basis of an estimate
	of approximately 3 billion neurons in the monkey cortex {(Shariff},
	'53), we estimate that between 2 and 3\% of all cortical neurons
	project to the opposite cerebral hemisphere. Subregions of the corpus
	callosum as well as each of the other commissures consist of characteristic
	subsets of five classes of axons and contain different proportions
	of myelinated to unmyelinated fibers. The largest myelinated axons
	and the smallest proportion of unmyelinated axons (approximately
	6\%) are found in regions of the corpus callosum that carry projections
	from primary sensory cortices, whereas the smallest myelinated axons
	and largest proportion of unmyelinated axons (approximately 30\%)
	are found in regions of the corpus callosum that carry projections
	from association cortices. Axon composition in the anterior commissure
	is uniform and resembles that of callosal sectors that contain association

  abstract = {We have studied the cytological and quantitative aspects of axon addition
	and elimination in the corpus callosum of the developing rhesus monkey.
	Electron microscopic analysis reveals that during fetal development
	the number of callosal axons increases from 4 million at embryonic
	day 65 {(E65)} to 188 million at birth {(E} 165). Thus, the number
	of callosal axons in newborn monkeys exceeds the number present in
	the adult (an average of 56 million; {LaMantia} and Rakic, 1990a)
	by at least 3.5 times. Although there is some variability among the
	11 fetal and newborn monkeys examined, there appears to be a progressive
	increase in the total number of callosal axons from midgestation
	through birth. The presence and numbers of growth cones from E65
	through birth suggests that axon addition occurs exclusively during
	this period. There is no ultrastructural or quantitative indication
	of postnatal axon addition. After birth, about 70\% of the axons
	in the callosum are eliminated in 2 phases. During the first phase,
	which includes the first 3 postnatal weeks, approximately 80 million
	axons are lost at an estimated rate of 4.4 million/d or 50/sec. During
	the second phase, which continues for the following 3 months, an
	additional 50 million axons are eliminated at a rate of 0.5 million/d
	or 5/sec until the adult value is reached. A discontinuous distribution
	of different classes of axons along the anterior-posterior axis of
	the tract reminiscent of the pattern seen in the adult is detectable
	before the onset of the first phase of axon elimination. Since the
	basic topography and terminal field patterns of callosal projections
	are well established before birth in all regions of the monkey cortex
	examined so far {(Goldman-Rakic} et al., 1983; Killackey and Chalupa,
	1986; Dehay et al., 1988; Schwartz and {Goldman-Rakic}, 1990), we
	conclude that the massive postnatal elimination of callosal axons
	described here is unlikely to play a significant role in the development
	of discretely patterned callosal projection zones or their columnar
	terminations. The coincidence of axon elimination and the increase
	in synaptic density throughout the primate cerebral cortex during
	the first 6 postnatal months {(Rakic} et al., 1986), however, suggests
	that supernumerary axons may be lost during a process that results
	in the local proliferation of synapses from a subset of initial interhemispheric
	projections.},

  abstract = {Recent {MRI} studies in multiple sclerosis have highlighted the potential
	importance of spinal cord atrophy (implicating axonal loss) in the
	development of disability. However, the techniques applied in these
	initial studies have poor reproducibility which limits their application
	in the serial monitoring of patients. The aim of this study was to
	develop a highly reproducible and accurate method for the quantification
	of atrophy. The technique we describe demonstrates an intra-observer
	coefficient of variation (scan-rescan) of only 0.8\%. When applied
	to 60 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis there
	was a strong correlation between spinal cord area and disability
	measured by Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status {Scale(EDSS)} (r
	= -0.7, P{\textless}{\textless}0.001). The correlation was graded
	providing evidence for a causal connection. At levels 3 and 8 of
	the {EDSS} we observed a reduction in average cord area of 12 and
	35\%,respectively. Given its reproducibility, the magnitude of the
	change detected and the strong correlation with disability, this
	new technique should prove to be a sensitive measure of progressive
	neurological deterioration and could be readily incorporated into
	imaging protocols aimed at monitoring therapy.},

  abstract = {Q-space magnetic resonance imaging {(QSI)} can quantify white matter
	{(WM)} axonal architecture at the cellular level non-destructively,
	unlike histology, but currently has several limitations. First, current
	methodology does not differentiate between diffusing molecules occupying
	extra- or intra-cellular spaces {(ECS} and {ICS}, respectively).
	Second, accurate assessment of axonal architecture requires high-gradient
	amplitudes not clinically available. Third, the only direct {QSI}
	marker of axonal architecture has been mean axon diameter {(MAD)},
	even though other direct markers would be valuable as well. The objective
	was to investigate three {QSI-based} methods that address the above
	limitations. Method 1 employs a two-compartment model to account
	for signal from {ECS} and {ICS.} Method 2 uses data only from low
	q-values thereby obviating the need for high-gradient amplitudes.
	Method 3 empirically estimates {ICS} volume fraction and provides
	an additional metric of axonal architecture. We implemented each
	method on data from excised healthy adult mouse spinal cords collected
	previously using a home-built {50T/m} z-gradient yielding sub-micron
	displacement resolution. Through comparison with histology, each
	method was evaluated for accuracy in assessing axonal architecture.
	{MAD} measured with Methods 1 and 2 showed good correlation with
	histology {(R2=0.99} (p{\textless}0.0001), and 0.77 (p{\textless}0.01),
	respectively) and {Bland-Altman} analysis indicates that measurements
	from the two methods are not significantly different from histology.
	The third method measured {ICS} volume fractions (0.64√Ç¬±0.07) that
	were highly correlated {(R2=0.92}, p{\textless}0.05) with measurements
	from histology (0.68√Ç¬±0.07). These methods may provide insight
	into axonal architecture in normal and abnormal {WM} tissue but additional
	validation with more samples will be needed.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to identify the minimum requirements for an accurate
	model of the diffusion {MR} signal in white matter of the brain.
	We construct a taxonomy of multi-compartment models of white matter
	from combinations of simple models for the intra- and the extra-axonal
	spaces. We devise a new diffusion {MRI} protocol that provides measurements
	with a wide range of imaging parameters for diffusion sensitization
	both parallel and perpendicular to white matter fibres. We use the
	protocol to acquire data from two fixed rat brains, which allows
	us to fit, study and compare the different models. The study examines
	a total of 47 analytic models, including several well-used models
	from the literature, which we place within the taxonomy. The results
	show that models that incorporate intra-axonal restriction, such
	as ball and stick or {CHARMED}, generally explain the data better
	than those that do not, such as the {DT} or the biexponential models.
	However, three-compartment models which account for restriction parallel
	to the axons and incorporate pore size explain the measurements most
	accurately. The best fit comes from combining a full diffusion tensor
	{(DT)} model of the extra-axonal space with a cylindrical intra-axonal
	component of single radius and a third spherical compartment of non-zero
	radius. We also measure the stability of the non-zero radius intra-axonal
	models and find that single radius intra-axonal models are more stable
	than gamma distributed radii models with similar fitting performance.},

  abstract = {This study investigates water diffusion changes in Wallerian degeneration.
	We measured indices derived from the diffusion tensor {(DT)} and
	T2-weighted signal intensities in the descending motor pathways of
	patients with small chronic lacunar infarcts of the posterior limb
	of the internal capsule on one side. We compared these measurements
	in the healthy and lesioned sides at different levels in the brainstem
	caudal to the primary lesion. We found that secondary white matter
	degeneration is revealed by a large reduction in diffusion anisotropy
	only in regions where fibers are arranged in isolated bundles of
	parallel fibers, such as in the cerebral peduncle. In regions where
	the degenerated pathway crosses other tracts, such as in the rostral
	pons, paradoxically there is almost no change in diffusion anisotropy,
	but a significant change in the measured orientation of fibers. The
	trace of the diffusion tensor is moderately increased in all affected
	regions. This allows one to differentiate secondary and primary fiber
	loss where the increase in trace is considerably higher. We show
	that {DT-MRI} is more sensitive than T2-weighted {MRI} in detecting
	Wallerian degeneration. Significant diffusion abnormalities are observed
	over the entire trajectory of the affected pathway in each patient.
	This finding suggests that mapping degenerated pathways noninvasively
	with {DT-MRI} is feasible. However, the interpretation of water diffusion
	data is complex and requires a priori information about anatomy and
	architecture of the pathway under investigation. In particular, our
	study shows that in regions where fibers cross, existing {DT-MRI-based}
	fiber tractography algorithms may lead to erroneous conclusion about
	brain connectivity.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} is being used to probe the central
	nervous system {(CNS)} of patients with multiple sclerosis {(MS)},
	a chronic demyelinating disease. Conventional T(2)-weighted {MRI}
	{(cMRI)} largely fails to predict the degree of patients' disability.
	This shortcoming may be due to poor specificity of {cMRI} for clinically
	relevant pathology. Diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)} has shown promise
	to be more specific for {MS} pathology. In this study we investigated
	the association between histological indices of myelin content, axonal
	count and gliosis, and two measures of {DTI} (mean diffusivity {[MD]}
	and fractional anisotropy {[FA])}, in unfixed post mortem {MS} brain
	using a {1.5-T} {MR} system. Both {MD} and {FA} were significantly
	lower in post mortem {MS} brain compared to published data acquired
	in vivo. However, the differences of {MD} and {FA} described in vivo
	between white matter lesions {(WMLs)} and normal-appearing white
	matter {(NAWM)} were retained in this study of post mortem brain:
	average {MD} in {WMLs} was 0.35x10(-3) mm(2)/s {(SD}, 0.09) versus
	0.22 (0.04) in {NAWM;} {FA} was 0.22 (0.06) in {WMLs} versus 0.38
	(0.13) in {NAWM.} Correlations were detected between myelin content
	{(Tr(myelin))} and (i) {FA} (r=-0.79, p{\textless}0.001), (ii) {MD}
	(r=0.68, p{\textless}0.001), and (iii) axonal count (r=-0.81, p{\textless}0.001).
	Multiple regression suggested that these correlations largely explain
	the apparent association of axonal count with (i) {FA} (r=0.70, p{\textless}0.001)
	and (ii) {MD} (r=-0.66, p{\textless}0.001). In conclusion, this study
	suggests that {FA} and {MD} are affected by myelin content and -
	to a lesser degree - axonal count in post mortem {MS} brain.},

	A microstructure parameter of particular interest is pore radius

	estimating pore size. The study demonstrated that optimised gradient
	waveform {(GEN)} protocols improve pore radius estimates compared

	their additional sensitivity to pore radius. We implement {GEN} and

	and constrained to maximum gradient strengths of 40, 80, 200 {mT}

	also demonstrate that {GEN} protocols provide improved sensitivity
	to the smaller pore radii when compared to optimised {PGSE} protocols,
	particularly at the lower gradient amplitudes investigated in this
	study. Our results suggest that this improved sensitivity of {GEN}

	constitutes a significant component of the pathology in compressive

	This provides a pathophysiological basis for √¢‚Ç¨≈ìdiscomplete√¢‚Ç¨ÔøΩ
	spinal cord injuries, characterized by apparently complete transection
	as judged by clinical criteria, but with neurophysiological evidence
	of conduction through the level of damage. Recovery of conduction
	in demyelinated axons may permit recovery of function, and can be
	mediated by several mechanisms, including remyelination by oligodendrocytes
	or Schwann cells. Alternatively, conduction of action potentials
	can occur in the absence of remyelination, but this requires plasticity
	of the demyelinated axon. The biophysics of conduction favors recovery
	of electrogenesis after demyelination of small diameter axons. This
	may account, in part, for the observation that functional recovery
	is more common after demyelination of visual, compared to spinal,
	axons. Restoration or modification of conduction in demyelinated
	fibers represents an important strategy for promoting functional

  abstract = {A spin-echo single-shot echo-planar imaging {(SS-EPI)} technique with
	a reduced field of view {(FOV)} in the phase-encoding direction is
	presented that simultaneously reduces susceptibility effects and
	motion artifacts in diffusion-weighted {(DW)} imaging {(DWI)} of
	the spinal cord at a high field strength {(3T).} To minimize aliasing,
	an outer volume suppression {(OVS)} sequence was implemented. Effective
	fat suppression was achieved with the use of a slice-selection gradient-reversal
	technique. The {OVS} was optimized by numerical simulations with
	respect to T1 relaxation times and B1 variations. The optimized sequence
	was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In simulations the optimized
	{OVS} showed suppression to {\textless}0.25\% and √¢ÀÜ¬º3\% in an
	optimal and worst-case scenario, respectively. In vitro measurements
	showed a mean residual signal of {\textless}0.95\% √Ç¬± 0.42 for
	all suppressed areas. In vivo acquisition with 0.9 √É‚Äì 1.05 mm2
	in-plane resolution resulted in artifact-free images. The short imaging
	time of this technique makes it promising for clinical studies. Magn

  abstract = {A debilitating consequence of complete spinal cord injury {(SCI)}
	is the loss of motor control. Although the goal of most {SCI} treatments
	is to re-establish neural connections, a potential complication in
	restoring motor function is that {SCI} may result in anatomical and
	functional changes in brain areas controlling motor output. Some
	animal investigations show cell death in the primary motor cortex
	following {SCI}, but similar anatomical changes in humans are not
	yet established. The aim of this investigation was to use voxel-based
	morphometry {(VBM)} and diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)} to determine
	if {SCI} in humans results in anatomical changes within motor cortices
	and descending motor pathways. Using {VBM}, we found significantly
	lower gray matter volume in complete {SCI} subjects compared with
	controls in the primary motor cortex, the medial prefrontal, and
	adjacent anterior cingulate cortices. {DTI} analysis revealed structural
	abnormalities in the same areas with reduced gray matter volume and
	in the superior cerebellar cortex. In addition, tractography revealed
	structural abnormalities in the corticospinal and corticopontine
	tracts of the {SCI} subjects. In conclusion, human subjects with
	complete {SCI} show structural changes in cortical motor regions
	and descending motor tracts, and these brain anatomical changes may
	limit motor recovery following {SCI.}},

  abstract = {Direct measurement of tissue microstructure with diffusion {MRI} offers
	a new class of markers, such as axon diameters, that give more specific
	information about tissue than measures derived from diffusion tensor
	imaging. The existing techniques of this kind assume a single axon
	orientation in the tissue model, which may be a reasonable approximation
	only for the most coherently oriented brain white matter, such as
	the corpus callosum. For most other areas, orientation dispersion
	is not negligible and, if unaccounted for, leads to overestimation
	of the axon diameters, prohibiting their accurate mapping over the
	whole brain. Here we propose a new model that captures the effect
	of orientation dispersion explicitly. A numerical scheme is developed
	to compute the diffusion signal prescribed by the proposed model
	efficiently, which supports the simultaneous estimation of the axon
	diameter and orientation dispersion. Synthetic data experiments demonstrate
	that the new model provides an axon diameter index that is robust
	to the presence of orientation dispersion. Results on in vivo human
	data show reduced axon diameter index and better agreement with histology
	compared to previous methods suggesting improvements in the axon
	diameter estimate.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)} and immunohistochemistry were used
	to examine axon injury in the rat spinal cord after unilateral {L(2)-L(4)}
	dorsal root axotomy at multiple time points (from 16 h to 30 d after
	surgery). Three days after axotomy, {DTI} revealed a lesion in the
	ipsilateral dorsal column extending from the lumbar to the cervical
	cord. The lesion showed significantly reduced parallel diffusivity
	and increased perpendicular diffusivity at day 3 compared with the
	contralateral unlesioned dorsal column. These findings coincided
	with loss of phosphorylated neurofilaments, accumulation of nonphosphorylated
	neurofilaments, swollen axons and formation of myelin ovoids, and
	no clear loss of myelin (stained by Luxol fast blue and 2'-3'-cyclic
	nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase). At day 30, {DTI} of the lesion
	continued to show significantly decreased parallel diffusivity. There
	was a slow but significant increase in perpendicular diffusivity
	between day 3 and day 30, which correlated with gradual clearance
	of myelin without further significant changes in neurofilament levels.
	These results show that parallel diffusivity can detect axon degeneration
	within 3 d after injury. The clearance of myelin at later stages
	may contribute to the late increase in perpendicular diffusivity,
	whereas the cause of its early increase at day 3 may be related to
	changes associated with primary axon injury. These data suggest that
	there is an early imaging signature associated with axon transections
	that could be used in a variety of neurological disease processes.},
