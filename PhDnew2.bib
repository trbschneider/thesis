  abstract = {{q-Space} diffusion {MRI} {(QSI)} provides a means of obtaining microstructural
	information about porous materials and neuronal tissues from diffusion
	data. However, the accuracy of this structural information depends
	on experimental parameters used to collect the {MR} data. {q-Space}
	diffusion {MR} performed on clinical scanners is generally collected
	with relatively long diffusion gradient pulses, in which the gradient
	pulse duration, delta, is comparable to the diffusion time, Delta.
	In this study, we used phantoms, consisting of ensembles of microtubes,
	and mathematical models to assess the effect of the ratio of the
	diffusion time and the duration of the diffusion pulse gradient,
	i.e., Delta/delta, on the {MR} signal attenuation vs. q, and on the
	measured structural information extracted therefrom. We found that
	for Delta/delta approximately 1, the diffraction pattern obtained
	from q-space {MR} data are shallower than when the short gradient
	pulse {(SGP)} approximation is satisfied. For long delta the estimated
	compartment size is, as expected, smaller than the real size. Interestingly,
	for Delta/delta approximately 1 the diffraction peaks are shifted
	to even higher q-values, even when delta is kept constant, giving
	the impression that the restricted compartments are even smaller
	than they are. When phantoms composed of microtubes of different
	diameters are used, it is more difficult to estimate the diameter
	distribution in this regime. Excellent agreement is found between
	the experimental results and simulations that explicitly account
	for the use of long duration gradient pulses. Using such experimental
	data and this mathematical framework, one can estimate the true compartment
	dimensions when long and finite gradient pulses are used even when
	Delta/delta approximately 1.},

	of injury intensity, suggesting a secondary pathologic origin. New
	morphometric studies of the subacute development of contusion lesions
	are described. Using electron microscopy and light microscopic line-sampling
	of myelinated axons, it was found that demyelination of axons that
	survived the initial injury occurred largely between 2 and 7 days
	after contusion and did not accompany the much more rapid dissolution
	of myelin from those axons that degenerated within the first 2 days.
	The number of apparently intact axons at the center of the lesion
	declined by a factor of 2 or more in the same interval of 2Ã¢â¬â7
	days. This secondary pathology was coincident with dense invasion

  abstract = {A systematic line-sampling method is described for counting and mapping
	myelinated axons in transverse sections of the spinal cord. Its advantages
	over random sampling of small areas are considered. The technique
	was applied to quantifying experimental weight-drop contusion injuries
	of cat spinal cord, from several months to more than a year after
	injury. Contusion of the mid-thoracic cord with a 20 g weight dropped
	20 cm was usually sufficient to produce chronic hindlimb paralysis
	whilst allowing the survival of significant numbers (40,000Ã¢â¬â110,000)
	of myelinated axons passing through the lesion site. The axons which
	survived were concentrated towards the pial surface. There was a
	proportionally greater loss of larger diameter axons, but this was
	independent of distance from the pia, indicating that at least two
	independent factors contribute to selective axonal death following
	injury, one related to depth within the cord, the other to axon diameter.
	Myelin sheath thickness was decreased from normal and this deficit
	also increased with depth. There was overlap in all these quantitative
	morphological characteristics between animals showing some recovery

	distal part, a process termed Wallerian degeneration {(WD).} While
	{WD} in the peripheral nervous system is usually followed by regeneration
	of the lesioned axons, central nervous system {(CNS)} neurons are
	generally unable to regrow. In this study, we investigated the process
	of {WD} in the dorsal columns of the rat spinal cord rostral to a
	mid-thoracic lesion. We confirm earlier studies describing a very
	delayed microglial and an early and sustained astroglial reaction
	finally leading to scar formation. Interestingly, we found a differential
	time course in the loss of myelin proteins depending on their location.
	Proteins situated on the periaxonal myelin membrane such as myelin
	associated glycoprotein disappeared early, within a few days after
	lesion, concomitantly with cytoskeletal axonal proteins, whereas
	compact myelin and outer myelin membrane proteins such as {MBP} and
	{Nogo-A} remained for long intervals in the degenerating tracts.
	Two distinct mechanisms are probably responsible for this difference:
	processes of protein destruction emanating from and initially probably
	located in the axon act on a time scale of 1-3 days. In contrast,
	the bulk of myelin destruction is due to phagocytosis known to be
	slow, prolonged, and inefficient in the {CNS.} These results may
	also have implications for future intervention strategies aiming

  abstract = {NMR q-space imaging is a method designed to obtain information from
	porous materials where diffusion-diffraction phenomena were observed
	from which pore size was derived. Recently, the technique has been
	applied to the study of biological structures as well. Although diffusive
	diffraction has so far not been observed in multicellular systems,
	displacement profiles have been used with some success as a means
	to estimate structure size. However, there have been no quantitative
	correlations of the retrieved structure sizes with histology. Clearly,
	the complexity of tissue architecture poses significant challenges
	to the interpretation of q-space data. In this work, simulations
	were first performed on a two-compartment model to demonstrate the
	effects of interference of the diffraction patterns arising from
	intra and extra-axonal compartments and finite boundary permeability
	on q-space data. Second, q-space echo attenuation was simulated on
	the basis of histologic images of various rat spinal cord fiber tracts
	and the information obtained from the displacement profiles were
	compared with structural parameters computed from the histologic
	images. The results show that calculated mean displacements and kurtosis
	parallel mean axon size and axonal density. Finally, spatially localized
	q-space measurements were carried out at the locations where simulations
	had previously been performed, resulting in displacement data that
	support those obtained by simulation. The data suggest the NMR q-space
	approach has potential for nondestructive analysis of the axonal
	architecture in the mammalian spinal cord. Magn Reson Med 52:733–740,

	by diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI).} We hypothesized that the {FLAIR}
	technique helps to improve {DTI} white matter tractography in the
	normal adult brain by eliminating {CSF} partial volume {effects.METHODS:}
	Seven healthy adults aged 23Ã¢â¬â37 underwent both conventional
	and {FLAIR} {DTI} at {1.5T.} Each subject was imaged five times.
	Neural fiber tractography was performed with both sequences by using
	two algorithms: a voxel-based method {(EZ-tracing)} with global seed
	points and another based on subvoxel tractography (tensor deflection)
	by using manual encircling of local seed points. Total volume of
	the fibers tracked was compared for the two types of {images.RESULTS:}
	Fiber tracking was substantially most successful on {FLAIR} {DTI}
	near the lateral ventricles and the sulci, where {CSF} partial volume
	effects were likely present. Minor false tracts on {FLAIR} images,
	possibly due to a reduced signal-to-noise ratio, were found in regions
	relatively free of {CSF} contamination; however, they did not affect
	tracking of major periventricular white matter bundles, such as those
	related to the corpus callosum or the corona radiata. When we excluded
	false tracts, the {FLAIR} technique depicted an average of 17\% more
	fibers in volume than conventional {DTI} in the periventricular regions
	{(P} {\textbackslash}textless .0005, paired Student t {test).CONCLUSION:}
	Despite the reduction of signal-to-noise ratio and longer imaging
	times, {FLAIR} improved tractography by eliminating {CSF} partial

	spinal cord injured {(SCI)} patients is crucial for assessing the
	prognosis of functional rehabilitation. Novel techniques based on
	diffusion-weighted {(DW)} magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} and
	magnetization transfer {(MT)} imaging provide sensitive and specific
	markers of white matter pathology. In this paper we combined for
	the first time high angular resolution diffusion-weighted imaging
	{(HARDI)}, {MT} imaging and atrophy measurements to evaluate the
	cervical spinal cord of fourteen {SCI} patients and age-matched controls.
	We used high in-plane resolution to delineate dorsal and ventrolateral
	pathways. Significant differences were detected between patients
	and controls in the normal-appearing white matter for fractional
	anisotropy {(FA}, p{\textless}0.0001), axial diffusivity (p{\textless}0.05),
	radial diffusivity (p{\textless}0.05), generalized fractional anisotropy
	{(GFA}, p{\textless}0.0001), magnetization transfer ratio {(MTR},
	p{\textless}0.0001) and cord area (p{\textless}0.05). No significant
	difference was detected in mean diffusivity (p=0.41), T1-weighted
	(p=0.76) and T2-weighted (p=0.09) signals. {MRI} metrics were remarkably
	well correlated with clinical disability {(Pearson's} correlations,

	p=0.01, {MTR:} p=0.04 and atrophy: p{\textless}0.01). Stepwise linear
	regressions showed that measures of {MTR} in the dorsal spinal cord
	predicted the sensory disability whereas measures of {MTR} in the
	ventro-lateral spinal cord predicted the motor disability {(ASIA}
	score). However, diffusion metrics were not specific to the sensorimotor
	scores. Due to the specificity of axial and radial diffusivity and
	{MT} measurements, results suggest the detection of demyelination
	and degeneration in {SCI} patients. Combining {HARDI} with {MT} imaging
	is a promising approach to gain specificity in characterizing spinal

  abstract = {During the past few years, several approaches to spinal-cord repair
	have been successfully established in animal models. For their use
	in trials of spinal-cord injury {(SCI)} in human beings, specific
	difficulties that affect the success of clinical trials have to be
	recognised. First, transection of the spinal cord is commonly applied
	in animal models, whereas contusion, which generally leads to injury
	in two to three segments, represents the typical injury mechanism
	in human beings. Second, the quadrupedal organisation of locomotion
	in animals and the more complex autonomic functions in human beings,
	challenge translation of animal behaviour into recovery from {SCI}
	in people. Third, the extensive damage of motor neurons and roots
	associated with spinal-cord contusion is not addressed in current
	translational studies. This damage has direct implications for rehabilitation
	strategies and functional outcome. Fourth, there is increasing evidence
	for a degradation of neuronal function below the level of the lesion
	in chronic complete {SCI.} The relevance of this degradation for
	a regeneration-inducing treatment needs to be investigated. Fifth,
	the prerequisites to enable appropriate reconnection of regenerating
	tract fibres in a postacute stage have still to be established.},

  abstract = {Oscillating gradients were used to probe the diffusion-time/frequency
	dependence of water diffusion in the gray matter of normal and globally
	ischemic rat brain. In terms of a conventional definition of diffusion
	time, the oscillating gradient measurements provided the apparent
	diffusion coefficient {(ADC)} of water with diffusion times between
	9.75 ms and 375 Œºs, an order of magnitude shorter than previously
	studied in vivo. Over this range, {ADCs} increased as much as 24\%
	in vivo and 50\% postmortem, depending on the nature of the oscillating
	gradient waveform used. Novel waveforms were employed to sample narrow
	frequency bands of the so-called diffusion spectrum. This spectral
	description of {ADC} includes the effects of restriction and/or flow,
	and is independent of experimental parameters, such as diffusion
	time. The results in rat brain were found to be consistent with restricted
	diffusion and the known micro-anatomy of gray matter. Differences
	between normal and postmortem data were consistent with an increase
	in water restriction and/or a decrease in flow, and tentatively suggest
	that physical changes following the onset of ischemia occur on a
	scale of about 2 Œºm, similar to a typical cellular dimension in

	constrained by hardware limits and fixed orientation, to minimize
	the expected variance of parameter estimates. The waveform is defined
	discretely and each point optimized independently. The method is
	illustrated with a biomedical application in which we maximize the
	sensitivity to microstructural features of white matter such as axon
	radius, intra-cellular volume fraction and diffusion constants. Simulation
	experiments find that optimization of the shape of the gradient waveform
	improves sensitivity to model parameters for both human and animal
	{MR} systems. In particular, the optimized waveforms make axon radii
	smaller than 5 Œºm more distinguishable than standard pulsed gradient
	spin-echo {(PGSE).} The identified class of optimized gradient waveforms
	have dominant square-wave components with frequency that increases

  abstract = {The impact of traumatic spinal cord injury on structural integrity,
	cortical reorganization and ensuing disability is variable and may
	depend on a dynamic interaction between the severity of local damage
	and the capacity of the brain for plastic reorganization. We investigated
	trauma-induced anatomical changes in the spinal cord and brain, and
	explored their relationship to functional changes in sensorimotor
	cortex. Structural changes were assessed using cross-sectional cord
	area, voxel-based morphometry and voxel-based cortical thickness
	of T1-weighted images in 10 subjects with cervical spinal cord injury
	and 16 controls. Cortical activation in response to right-sided (i)
	handgrip; and (ii) median and tibial nerve stimulation were assessed
	using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Regression analyses
	explored associations between cord area, grey and white matter volume,
	cortical activations and thickness, and disability. Subjects with
	spinal cord injury had impaired upper and lower limb function bilaterally,
	a 30\% reduced cord area, smaller white matter volume in the pyramids
	and left cerebellar peduncle, and smaller grey matter volume and
	cortical thinning in the leg area of the primary motor and sensory
	cortex compared with controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
	revealed increased activation in the left primary motor cortex leg
	area during handgrip and the left primary sensory cortex face area
	during median nerve stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury
	compared with controls, but no increased activation following tibial
	nerve stimulation. A smaller cervical cord area was associated with
	impaired upper limb function and increased activations with handgrip
	and median nerve stimulation, but reduced activations with tibial
	nerve stimulation. Increased sensory deficits were associated with
	increased activations in the left primary sensory cortex face area
	due to median nerve stimulation. In conclusion, spinal cord injury
	leads to cord atrophy, cortical atrophy of primary motor and sensory
	cortex, and cortical reorganization of the sensorimotor system. The

	{WMH} are only weakly and inconsistently associated with cognitive

	increase specificity for these neuropathological changes. We assessed
	whether post-mortem quantitative {MRI} is able to reflect differences
	in neuropathological correlates of {WMH} in tissue samples obtained
	post-mortem from Alzheimer's disease patients and from non-demented
	{elderly.Thirty-three} formalin-fixed, coronal brain slices from
	11 Alzheimer's disease patients (mean age: 83 ÃÂ± 10 years, eight
	females) and 15 slices from seven non-demented controls (mean age:
	78 ÃÂ± 10 years, four females) with {WMH} were scanned at 1.5 T
	using qualitative (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, {FLAIR)}
	and quantitative {MRI} [diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)} including
	estimation of apparent diffusion coefficient {(ADC)} and fractional
	anisotropy {(FA)}, and T1-relaxation time mapping based on flip-angle
	array). A total of 104 regions of interest were defined on {FLAIR}
	images in {WMH} and normal appearing white matter {(NAWM).} Neuropathological
	examination included (semi-)quantitative assessment of axonal density
	{(Bodian)}, myelin density {(LFB)}, astrogliosis {(GFAP)} and microglial
	activation {(HLA-DR).} Patient groups {(Alzheimer's} disease versus
	controls) and tissue types {(WMH} versus {NAWM)} were compared with
	respect to {QMRI} and neuropathological measures. Overall, Alzheimer's
	disease patients had significantly lower {FA} {(P} {\textbackslash}textless
	0.01) and higher T1-values than controls {(P} = 0.04). {WMH} showed
	lower {FA} {(P} {\textbackslash}textless 0.01) and higher T1-values
	{(P} {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) than {NAWM} in both patient
	groups. A significant interaction between patient group and tissue
	type was found for the T1 measurements, indicating that the difference
	in T1-relaxation time between {NAWM} and {WMH} was larger in Alzheimer's
	disease patients than in non-demented controls. All neuropathological
	measures showed differences between {WMH} and {NAWM}, although the
	difference in microglial activation was specific for Alzheimer's
	disease. Multivariate regression models revealed that in Alzheimer's
	disease, axonal density was an independent determinant of {FA}, whereas
	T1 was independently determined by axonal and myelin density and
	microglial activation. Quantitative {MRI} techniques reveal differences
	in {WMH} between Alzheimer's disease and non-demented elderly, and
	are able to reflect the severity of the neuropathological changes

	signs of post mortal destructions. The periodicity of the lamellae
	is preserved and varies about 17 nm. For quantitative purposes specimens
	were taken at random from regions with an extend of half a mm2 on
	the cross section of the pyramid. On the average 62 lamellae (s =
	5, n = 200) built up 1 micron myelin sheath in the 4 brains. The
	myelin sheath thickness and the inner circumference of the myelin
	sheath are measured. The axon diameter is calculated from the inner
	circumference. We obtained an average number of 66,000 fibres, s
	= 11,000 per mm2. Fibres with a total diameter below 4 microns amount
	to 87.9\%, fibres from 4 to 10 microns to 10.77\%, and larger than
	10 microns to 1.4\%. An axon diameter of about 0.5 micron combined
	with a thickness of the myelin sheath of 0.3 micron was most often
	found in all 4 cases. The fibres showed a broad variation of myelin
	thickness. In a given group of the small axons the thickest myelin
	sheath exceeded 3 to 4 times the value of the thinnest one. The coefficient
	of correlation between axon diameter and myelin sheath thickness
	was calculated as r2 = 0.56. No correspondence exists between frequency
	maxima and the ratio g, axon diameter to total diameter. Below a
	total fibre diameter of 5 microns the ratio g scatters broadly about
	0.6, fibres larger than 5 microns exceed the value of 0.6. From the
	morphological data only large sized fibres can evoke a strong effect
	on compound action potentials if the method of reconstruction of
	the action potential from fibre size frequency distribution is employed.},

  abstract = {The number, types, and distribution of distinct classes of axons and
	glia in four cerebral commissures of the adult rhesus monkey {(Macaca}
	mulatta) were determined using electron microscopic and immunocytochemical
	methods. The two neocortical commissures, the corpus callosum, and
	the anterior commissure contain small but cytologically distinct
	archicortical components: the hippocampal commissure, which lies
	ventral to the splenium of the corpus callosum, and the basal telencephalic
	commissure, which forms a small crescent at the anterior margin of
	the anterior commissure. Each archicortical pathway is delineated
	from the adjacent neocortical commissure by a glial capsule. The
	glia cells that form this border are immunoreactive with antisera
	directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein {(GFAP)} and issue
	long processes that form numerous desmosomal junctions with one another.
	Braids of these glial processes envelop axonal fascicles within the
	archicortical commissures. In contrast, the {GFAP-positive} cells
	of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure are randomly distributed
	cells with relatively short stellate processes that do not form boundaries
	around axon fascicles. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis
	reveals that approximately 60 million axons connect the two cerebral
	hemispheres: the corpus callosum contains 56.0 million +/- 3.8 million
	axons (n = 8), the anterior commissure contains 3.15 million +/-
	0.24 million axons (n = 8), the hippocampal commissure has 237,000
	axons +/- 31,000 (n = 6), and the basal telencephalic commissure
	has 193,000 axons +/- 28,000 (n = 5). The number of axons is not
	directly proportional to the cross-sectional area in any of the commissures
	because of variation in axonal composition. On the basis of an estimate
	of approximately 3 billion neurons in the monkey cortex {(Shariff},
	'53), we estimate that between 2 and 3\% of all cortical neurons
	project to the opposite cerebral hemisphere. Subregions of the corpus
	callosum as well as each of the other commissures consist of characteristic
	subsets of five classes of axons and contain different proportions
	of myelinated to unmyelinated fibers. The largest myelinated axons
	and the smallest proportion of unmyelinated axons (approximately
	6\%) are found in regions of the corpus callosum that carry projections
	from primary sensory cortices, whereas the smallest myelinated axons
	and largest proportion of unmyelinated axons (approximately 30\%)
	are found in regions of the corpus callosum that carry projections
	from association cortices. Axon composition in the anterior commissure
	is uniform and resembles that of callosal sectors that contain association

  abstract = {We have studied the cytological and quantitative aspects of axon addition
	and elimination in the corpus callosum of the developing rhesus monkey.
	Electron microscopic analysis reveals that during fetal development
	the number of callosal axons increases from 4 million at embryonic
	day 65 {(E65)} to 188 million at birth {(E} 165). Thus, the number
	of callosal axons in newborn monkeys exceeds the number present in
	the adult (an average of 56 million; {LaMantia} and Rakic, 1990a)
	by at least 3.5 times. Although there is some variability among the
	11 fetal and newborn monkeys examined, there appears to be a progressive
	increase in the total number of callosal axons from midgestation
	through birth. The presence and numbers of growth cones from E65
	through birth suggests that axon addition occurs exclusively during
	this period. There is no ultrastructural or quantitative indication
	of postnatal axon addition. After birth, about 70\% of the axons
	in the callosum are eliminated in 2 phases. During the first phase,
	which includes the first 3 postnatal weeks, approximately 80 million
	axons are lost at an estimated rate of 4.4 million/d or 50/sec. During
	the second phase, which continues for the following 3 months, an
	additional 50 million axons are eliminated at a rate of 0.5 million/d
	or 5/sec until the adult value is reached. A discontinuous distribution
	of different classes of axons along the anterior-posterior axis of
	the tract reminiscent of the pattern seen in the adult is detectable
	before the onset of the first phase of axon elimination. Since the
	basic topography and terminal field patterns of callosal projections
	are well established before birth in all regions of the monkey cortex
	examined so far {(Goldman-Rakic} et al., 1983; Killackey and Chalupa,
	1986; Dehay et al., 1988; Schwartz and {Goldman-Rakic}, 1990), we
	conclude that the massive postnatal elimination of callosal axons
	described here is unlikely to play a significant role in the development
	of discretely patterned callosal projection zones or their columnar
	terminations. The coincidence of axon elimination and the increase
	in synaptic density throughout the primate cerebral cortex during
	the first 6 postnatal months {(Rakic} et al., 1986), however, suggests
	that supernumerary axons may be lost during a process that results
	in the local proliferation of synapses from a subset of initial interhemispheric
	projections.},

	is also investigated. Signal phase and spin exchange are necessary

	35\%,respectively. Given its reproducibility, the magnitude of the

	the whole-body hardware to acquire in vivo DTI images of rat brain.
	The resolution allowed for fiber tracking evaluation of fractional

	splenium of the corpus callosum. A comparison of short (46 min) and
	long (92 min) acquisition time DTI protocols indicated low but adequate

	to conduct quantitative fiber tracking enhanced by multiple acquisitions.
	As observed in human studies, FA in the rat splenium was higher than
	in the genu. Advantages of this technology include the use of similar
	user interface, pulse sequences, and field strength for preclinical
	animal and clinical human research, enhancing translational capabilities.
	An additional benefit of scanning at lower field strength, such as

  abstract = {The effects of finite gradient-pulse widths on NMR diffusion measurements
	for fluids in restricting geometries are studied. It is shown that
	the echo amplitude is the spatial Fourier transform of a "center-of-mass"
	propagator, which reduces to the usual diffusion propagator in the
	limit of zero pulse widths. A finite gradient-pulse width δ effectively
	changes the pore shape, making isolated pores appear smaller than
	their actual size. The diffraction analogy still holds for long diffusion
	times, with the fluid density ρ(r) being replaced by pcm(r, δ). This
	quantity, the "center-of-mass distribution function," is the spatial
	probability distribution of the center of mass of Brownian trajectories
	of duration δ in the pore space. For a periodic pore space, "Bragg"
	peaks still appear in the amplitude at the reciprocal lattice vectors.
	The heights of these peaks are enhanced for small δ but reduced for
	δ. A number of results valid for small δ and piecewise smooth pore
	surfaces are presented.},

	on the appearance of high b-value q-space diffusion MR images of
	excised rat spinal cord (SC) was evaluated. The water signal decays
	in the white (WM) and gray matter (GM) were analyzed when the diffusion
	was measured perpendicular (⟂) and parallel (‖) to the fibers of
	the SC, using three different approaches: single-component q-space
	analysis, the biexponential model, and the bi-Gaussian fit of the
	displacement distribution profile. Probability and displacement contrast
	and anisotropy indices were calculated for the WM and GM. It was
	found that WM/GM contrast increases as the diffusion time is increased
	when diffusion is measured perpendicular to the long axis of the
	SC. At a diffusion time of 50 ms, when diffusion was measured parallel
	to the fibers of the SC, the displacement was found to be higher
	for GM as compared to WM. For this direction the WM/GM contrast increased
	when diffusion time was increased, although here the changes were
	much less pronounced than for the perpendicular direction. The WM/GM
	displacement contrast nearly disappears for a diffusion time of 150
	ms, when diffusion is measured parallel to the fibers of the SC.
	As expected, the anisotropy indices were found to be higher in WM
	than in GM, and increased with the increase in diffusion time. Both
	δ and TE affected the extracted parameters. It was found that long
	δ and long TE overemphasizes the apparent slow-diffusing water component
	of the SC, which is also the more restricted one. It is demonstrated
	that the single-component q-space analysis best describes diffusion
	in WM when diffusion is measured perpendicular to the fibers of the
	SC. In other cases, a more complete description is obtained by using
	two-component models. Magn Reson Med 54:96–104, 2005. © 2005 Wiley-Liss,

	model of the diffusion {MR} signal in white matter of the brain.
	We construct a taxonomy of multi-compartment models of white matter
	from combinations of simple models for the intra- and the extra-axonal
	spaces. We devise a new diffusion {MRI} protocol that provides measurements
	with a wide range of imaging parameters for diffusion sensitization
	both parallel and perpendicular to white matter fibres. We use the
	protocol to acquire data from two fixed rat brains, which allows
	us to fit, study and compare the different models. The study examines
	a total of 47 analytic models, including several well-used models
	from the literature, which we place within the taxonomy. The results
	show that models that incorporate intra-axonal restriction, such
	as ball and stick or {CHARMED}, generally explain the data better
	than those that do not, such as the {DT} or the biexponential models.
	However, three-compartment models which account for restriction parallel
	to the axons and incorporate pore size explain the measurements most
	accurately. The best fit comes from combining a full diffusion tensor
	{(DT)} model of the extra-axonal space with a cylindrical intra-axonal
	component of single radius and a third spherical compartment of non-zero
	radius. We also measure the stability of the non-zero radius intra-axonal
	models and find that single radius intra-axonal models are more stable
	than gamma distributed radii models with similar fitting performance.},

  abstract = {This study investigates water diffusion changes in Wallerian degeneration.
	We measured indices derived from the diffusion tensor {(DT)} and
	T2-weighted signal intensities in the descending motor pathways of
	patients with small chronic lacunar infarcts of the posterior limb
	of the internal capsule on one side. We compared these measurements
	in the healthy and lesioned sides at different levels in the brainstem
	caudal to the primary lesion. We found that secondary white matter
	degeneration is revealed by a large reduction in diffusion anisotropy
	only in regions where fibers are arranged in isolated bundles of
	parallel fibers, such as in the cerebral peduncle. In regions where
	the degenerated pathway crosses other tracts, such as in the rostral
	pons, paradoxically there is almost no change in diffusion anisotropy,
	but a significant change in the measured orientation of fibers. The
	trace of the diffusion tensor is moderately increased in all affected
	regions. This allows one to differentiate secondary and primary fiber
	loss where the increase in trace is considerably higher. We show
	that {DT-MRI} is more sensitive than T2-weighted {MRI} in detecting
	Wallerian degeneration. Significant diffusion abnormalities are observed
	over the entire trajectory of the affected pathway in each patient.
	This finding suggests that mapping degenerated pathways noninvasively
	with {DT-MRI} is feasible. However, the interpretation of water diffusion
	data is complex and requires a priori information about anatomy and
	architecture of the pathway under investigation. In particular, our
	study shows that in regions where fibers cross, existing {DT-MRI-based}
	fiber tractography algorithms may lead to erroneous conclusion about
	brain connectivity.},

	for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the spinal cord, because
	of the magnetic field inhomogeneities around the spine, the small
	cross-sectional size of the spinal cord, and the increased motion
	in that area due to breathing, swallowing, and cerebrospinal fluid
	(CSF) pulsation. These result in artifacts with the usually long
	readout duration of the ss-EPI method. Reduced field-of-view (FOV)
	methods decrease the required readout duration for ss-EPI, thereby

	(ss-DWEPI) method is proposed, in which a 2D spatially selective
	echo-planar RF excitation pulse and a 180° refocusing pulse reduce
	the FOV in the phase-encode (PE) direction, while suppressing the
	signal from fat simultaneously. With this method, multi slice images
	with higher in-plane resolutions (0.94 × 0.94 mm2 for sagittal and
	0.62 × 0.62 mm2 for axial images) are achieved at 1.5 T, without

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging {(MRI)} is being used to probe the central
	nervous system {(CNS)} of patients with multiple sclerosis {(MS)},
	a chronic demyelinating disease. Conventional T(2)-weighted {MRI}
	{(cMRI)} largely fails to predict the degree of patients' disability.
	This shortcoming may be due to poor specificity of {cMRI} for clinically
	relevant pathology. Diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)} has shown promise
	to be more specific for {MS} pathology. In this study we investigated
	the association between histological indices of myelin content, axonal
	count and gliosis, and two measures of {DTI} (mean diffusivity {[MD]}
	and fractional anisotropy {[FA])}, in unfixed post mortem {MS} brain
	using a {1.5-T} {MR} system. Both {MD} and {FA} were significantly
	lower in post mortem {MS} brain compared to published data acquired
	in vivo. However, the differences of {MD} and {FA} described in vivo
	between white matter lesions {(WMLs)} and normal-appearing white
	matter {(NAWM)} were retained in this study of post mortem brain:
	average {MD} in {WMLs} was 0.35x10(-3) mm(2)/s {(SD}, 0.09) versus
	0.22 (0.04) in {NAWM;} {FA} was 0.22 (0.06) in {WMLs} versus 0.38
	(0.13) in {NAWM.} Correlations were detected between myelin content
	{(Tr(myelin))} and (i) {FA} (r=-0.79, p{\textless}0.001), (ii) {MD}
	(r=0.68, p{\textless}0.001), and (iii) axonal count (r=-0.81, p{\textless}0.001).
	Multiple regression suggested that these correlations largely explain
	the apparent association of axonal count with (i) {FA} (r=0.70, p{\textless}0.001)
	and (ii) {MD} (r=-0.66, p{\textless}0.001). In conclusion, this study

	A microstructure parameter of particular interest is pore radius

	implementing {GEN} protocols on a small bore 9.4 T scanner and verifies
	their additional sensitivity to pore radius. We implement {GEN} and

	pore radius for each phantom, using microcapillary fibres. The measured
	signal shows good agreement with simulated signal, strongly indicating
	that the {GEN} waveforms can be implemented on a 9.4 T system. We
	also demonstrate that {GEN} protocols provide improved sensitivity
	to the smaller pore radii when compared to optimised {PGSE} protocols,

	Currently, there does not exist a noninvasive biological marker that
	enables differentiation between myelin and axonal injury. We describe
	herein the use of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)}
	to quantify the effect of dysmyelination on water directional diffusivities
	in brains of shiverer mice in vivo. The principal diffusion eigenvalues
	of eight axonal fiber tracts that can be identified with certainty
	on {DTI} maps were measured. The water diffusivity perpendicular
	to axonal fiber tracts, \$Åambda\$Ã¢Å Â¥, was significantly higher
	in shiverer mice compared with age-matched controls, reflecting the
	lack of myelin and the increased freedom of cross-fiber diffusion
	in white matter. The water diffusivity parallel to axonal fiber tracts,
	\$Åambda\$Ã¢ËÂ¥, was not different, which is consistent with the
	presence of intact axons. It is clear that dysmyelination alone does
	not impact \$Åambda\$Ã¢ËÂ¥. The presence of intact axons in the
	setting of incomplete myelination was confirmed by electron microscopy.
	Although further validation is still needed, our finding suggests
	that changes in \$Åambda\$Ã¢Å Â¥ and \$Åambda\$Ã¢ËÂ¥ may potentially
	be used to differentiate myelin loss versus axonal injury.},

	diseases, impairs axonal conduction and can also be associated with
	axonal degeneration. Accurate assessments of these conditions may
	be highly beneficial in evaluating and selecting therapeutic strategies
	for patient management. Recently, an analytical approach examining
	diffusion tensor imaging {(DTI)} derived parameters has been proposed
	to assess the extent of axonal damage, demyelination, or both. The
	current study uses the well-characterized cuprizone model of experimental
	demyelination and remyelination of corpus callosum in mouse brain
	to evaluate the ability of {DTI} parameters to detect the progression
	of myelin degeneration and regeneration. Our results demonstrate
	that the extent of increased radial diffusivity reflects the severity
	of demyelination in corpus callosum of mouse brain affected by cuprizone
	treatment. Subsequently, radial diffusivity decreases with the progression
	of remyelination. Furthermore, radial diffusivity changes were specific
	to the time course of changes in myelin integrity as distinct from
	axonal injury, which was detected by {betaAPP} immunostaining and
	shown to be most extensive prior to demyelination. Radial diffusivity
	offers a specific assessment of demyelination and remyelination,

	This similarity is assessed based on the squared difference between

	respect to the original implementation is over one order of magnitude,

	our method is nearly twice as fast. At the same time, we evidence
	from both synthetic and in vivo experiments that computing of appropriate
	salient features make the estimation of {NLM} weights more robust
	to noise. Consequently, we are able to improve the outcomes achieved
	with recent state of the art techniques for a wide range of realistic

  abstract = {Morphological and physiological studies demonstrate that demyelination
	constitutes a significant component of the pathology in compressive
	spinal cord injury. In many cases of spinal cord injury, a rim of
	demyelinated axons surrounds a central core of hemorrhagic necrosis.
	This provides a pathophysiological basis for discomplete spinal cord
	injuries, characterized by apparently complete transection as judged
	by clinical criteria, but with neurophysiological evidence of conduction
	through the level of damage. Recovery of conduction in demyelinated
	axons may permit recovery of function, and can be mediated by several
	mechanisms, including remyelination by oligodendrocytes or Schwann
	cells. Alternatively, conduction of action potentials can occur in
	the absence of remyelination, but this requires plasticity of the
	demyelinated axon. The biophysics of conduction favors recovery of
	electrogenesis after demyelination of small diameter axons. This
	may account, in part, for the observation that functional recovery
	is more common after demyelination of visual, compared to spinal,
	axons. Restoration or modification of conduction in demyelinated
	fibers represents an important strategy for promoting functional
	recovery in spinal cord injury.},

  abstract = {This study describes a new technique for Diffusion Tensor Imaging
	(DTI) that acquires axial (transverse) images of the cervical spinal
	cord. The DTI images depict axonal fiber orientation, enable quantification
	of diffusion characteristics along the spinal cord, and have the
	potential to demonstrate the connectivity of cord white matter tracts.
	Because of the high sensitivity to motion of diffusion-weighted magnetic
	resonance imaging and the small size of the spinal cord, a fast imaging
	method with high in-plane resolution was developed. Images were acquired
	with a single-shot EPI technique, named ZOOM-EPI (zonally magnified
	oblique multislice echo planar imaging), which selects localized
	areas and reduces artefacts caused by susceptibility changes between
	soft tissue and the adjacent vertebrae. Cardiac gating was used to
	reduce pulsatile flow artefacts from the surrounding cerebrospinal
	fluid. Voxel resolution was 1.25 × 1.25 mm2 in-plane with 5-mm slice
	thickness. Both the mean diffusivity (MD) and the fractional anisotropy
	(FA) indices of the cervical spinal cord were measured. The FA index
	demonstrated high anisotropy of the spinal cord with an average value
	of 0.61 ± 0.05 (highest value of 0.66 ± 0.03 at C3), comparable to
	white matter tracts in the brain. The diffusivity components parallel
	and orthogonal to the longitudinal axes of the cord were λ∥ = (1648
	± 123) × 10−6 mm2s−1 and λ⊥ = (570 ± 47) × 10−6 mm2 s−1, respectively.
	The high axial resolution allowed preliminary evaluation of fiber
	connectivity using the fast-marching tractography algorithm, which
	generated traces of fiber paths consistent with the well-known cord
	anatomy.},

  abstract = {An essential step for fibre-tracking is the accurate estimation of
	neuronal fibre orientations within each imaging voxel, and a number
	of methods have been proposed to reconstruct the orientation distribution
	function based on sampling three-dimensional q-space. In the q-space
	formalism, very short (infinitesimal) gradient pulses are the basic
	requirement to obtain the true spin displacement probability density
	function. On current clinical {MR} systems however, the diffusion
	gradient pulse duration (Œ¥) is inevitably finite due to the limit
	on the achievable gradient intensity. The failure to satisfy the
	short gradient pulse {(SGP)} requirement has been a recurrent criticism
	for fibre orientation estimation based on the q-space approach. In
	this study, the influence of a finite Œ¥ on the {DW} signal measured
	as a function of gradient direction is described theoretically and
	demonstrated through simulations and experimental models. Our results
	suggest that the current practice of using long Œ¥ for {DW} imaging
	on human clinical {MR} scanners, which is enforced by hardware limitations,
	might in fact be beneficial for estimating fibre orientations. For
	a given b-value, the prolongation of Œ¥ is advantageous for estimating
	fibre orientations for two reasons: first, it leads to a boost in
	{DW} signal in the transverse plane of the fibre. Second, it stretches
	out the shape of the measured diffusion profile, which improves the
	contrast between {DW} orientations. This is especially beneficial
	for resolving crossing fibres, as this contrast is essential to discriminate
	between different fibre directions.},

  abstract = {Direct measurement of tissue microstructure with diffusion {MRI} offers
	a new class of markers, such as axon diameters, that give more specific
	information about tissue than measures derived from diffusion tensor

	orientation in the tissue model, which may be a reasonable approximation
	only for the most coherently oriented brain white matter, such as
	the corpus callosum. For most other areas, orientation dispersion
	is not negligible and, if unaccounted for, leads to overestimation
	of the axon diameters, prohibiting their accurate mapping over the
	whole brain. Here we propose a new model that captures the effect
	of orientation dispersion explicitly. A numerical scheme is developed
	to compute the diffusion signal prescribed by the proposed model
	efficiently, which supports the simultaneous estimation of the axon
	diameter and orientation dispersion. Synthetic data experiments demonstrate
	that the new model provides an axon diameter index that is robust
	to the presence of orientation dispersion. Results on in vivo human
	data show reduced axon diameter index and better agreement with histology

	dorsal root axotomy at multiple time points (from 16 h to 30 d after

	cord. The lesion showed significantly reduced parallel diffusivity
	and increased perpendicular diffusivity at day 3 compared with the
	contralateral unlesioned dorsal column. These findings coincided
	with loss of phosphorylated neurofilaments, accumulation of nonphosphorylated
	neurofilaments, swollen axons and formation of myelin ovoids, and
	no clear loss of myelin (stained by Luxol fast blue and 2'-3'-cyclic

	of myelin without further significant changes in neurofilament levels.
	These results show that parallel diffusivity can detect axon degeneration

	may contribute to the late increase in perpendicular diffusivity,
