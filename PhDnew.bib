	Thin fibers are most dense in the anterior corpus callosum (genu),

	where they reach a minimum. Towards the posterior corpus callosum
	(splenium), the density of thin fibers increases again, but in the

	fibers show a pattern complementary to that of thin fibers, having
	a peak of density in the posterior midbody and a local increase of
	density in the posterior pole of the corpus callosum. Across subjects,
	the overall density of callosal fibers had no significant correlation
	with callosal area and an increased callosal area indicated an increased
	total number of fibers crossing through. Considering different fiber

  abstract = {The diffusion tensor is currently the accepted model of diffusion

	complex when two or more distinct tissues with different diffusion
	tensors occupy the same voxel. In this study, a partial volume model
	of MRI signal behavior for two diffusion-tensor compartments is presented.
	Simulations using this model demonstrate that the conventional single
	diffusion tensor model could lead to highly variable and inaccurate
	measurements of diffusion behavior. The differences between the single
	and two-tensor models depend on the orientations, fractions, and
	exchange between the two diffusion tensor compartments, as well as
	the diffusion-tensor encoding technique and diffusion-weighting that
	is used in the measurements. The current single compartment model's
	inaccuracies could cause diffusion-based characterization of cerebral
	ischemia and white matter connectivity to be incorrect. A diffusion-tensor
	MRI imaging experiment on a normal human brain revealed significant
	partial volume effects between oblique white matter regions when
	using very large voxels and large diffusion-weighting (b approximately
	2.69 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)). However, the apparent partial volume effects

	were used. For diffusion tensor studies obtained using typical diffusion-weighting
	values (b approximately 1 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)) partial volume effects
	are much more difficult to detect and resolve. More accurate measurements
	of multiple diffusion compartments may lead to improved confidence

	delta, is comparable to the diffusion time, Delta. In this study,
	we used phantoms, consisting of ensembles of microtubes, and mathematical
	models to assess the effect of the ratio of the diffusion time and
	the duration of the diffusion pulse gradient, i.e., Delta/delta,
	on the MR signal attenuation vs. q, and on the measured structural
	information extracted therefrom. We found that for Delta/delta approximately
	1, the diffraction pattern obtained from q-space MR data are shallower
	than when the short gradient pulse (SGP) approximation is satisfied.
	For long delta the estimated compartment size is, as expected, smaller
	than the real size. Interestingly, for Delta/delta approximately
	1 the diffraction peaks are shifted to even higher q-values, even
	when delta is kept constant, giving the impression that the restricted
	compartments are even smaller than they are. When phantoms composed
	of microtubes of different diameters are used, it is more difficult
	to estimate the diameter distribution in this regime. Excellent agreement
	is found between the experimental results and simulations that explicitly
	account for the use of long duration gradient pulses. Using such
	experimental data and this mathematical framework, one can estimate
	the true compartment dimensions when long and finite gradient pulses
	are used even when Delta/delta approximately 1.},

  abstract = {High b-value q-space diffusion MRS was used to study the diffusion
	characteristics of formalin-fixed swine optic and sciatic nerves
	over a large range of diffusion times (3.7-99.3 ms). The very short
	diffusion time range was studied with a 1 ms resolution. The displacement
	distribution profiles obtained were fitted to a bi-Gaussian function,
	and structural parameters were extracted from the q-space diffusion
	MRS data. This structural information was correlated with axon sizes
	obtained by histological examination. It was found that high b-value
	q-space diffusion MRS can easily distinguish between the two nerve
	types. The root mean square displacements (rmsds) of both the slow
	and fast diffusing components of the optic nerves were found to be
	smaller than those of the sciatic nerves. When the rmsd was plotted
	against the square root of the diffusion time (t(d)(1/2)), it was
	found that all four components showed an increase in rmsd; this increase
	was significantly smaller than expected from the Einstein equation.
	However, the most restricted component is the slow diffusing component
	of the optic nerve. This is also the only diffusing component that
	shows a large change in the slope (i.e. a 'breaking point') of the
	plot of rmsd as a function of t(d)(1/2). This rmsd is very similar
	to the mean axon size of these optic nerves determined histologically.
	Such a change in slope was less apparent for the slow diffusing component
	of sciatic nerves, which showed a wider distribution of axon size
	in histological images. The fast diffusing components of both nerve
	types showed only a small gradual change in the slope of rmsd plotted
	against t(d)(1/2). These findings are discussed in the context of
	component assignment, origin of restriction, and relationships between

	of cat spinal cord, from several months to more than a year after
	injury. Contusion of the mid-thoracic cord with a 20 g weight dropped
	20 cm was usually sufficient to produce chronic hindlimb paralysis
	whilst allowing the survival of significant numbers (40,000â€“110,000)
	of myelinated axons passing through the lesion site. The axons which
	survived were concentrated towards the pial surface. There was a

	independent of distance from the pia, indicating that at least two
	independent factors contribute to selective axonal death following
	injury, one related to depth within the cord, the other to axon diameter.
	Myelin sheath thickness was decreased from normal and this deficit
	also increased with depth. There was overlap in all these quantitative
	morphological characteristics between animals showing some recovery

	experimental contusion injury of cat thoracic spinal cord was studied

	the light microscope. Injuries were produced by a weight-drop apparatus,
	with the vertebral body (T9) below the impact stabilized by supports
	under the transverse processes. The effects of two combinations of
	weight and height were examined: 10 or 13 g dropped 20cm onto an
	impact area of 5 mm diameter. Animals were kept for 3â€“5 months
	after injury, then fixed by perfusion for histological analysis.
	The number of surviving myelinated axons was found to vary both with
	the weight used and with the size of the spinal cord. A measure of
	impact intensity was derived from the calculated momentum of the
	weight at impact divided by the cross sectional area of the cord
	(interpolated from dimensions measured rostral and caudal of the
	lesion following fixation). At impact intensities > 0.02 kg-m/s/cm2
	there was practically no survival of axons at the center of the injury
	site, combined with almost complete breakdown of the pial margin.
	Between 0.08 and 0.2 kg-m/s/cm2 the number of surviving axons varied
	between 100,000 and 2000, approximating a negative exponential function
	(r = âˆ’0.88). The number of axons surviving in the outer 100 $\mu$m
	of the cord varied practically linearly (r = âˆ’0.82) between near
	normal and < 1\% of normal over the same range of injury intensity.
	The number of surviving axons decreased with depth from the pia,
	also approximating a negative exponential function, with a 10-fold
	decrease in density over approximately 500 $\mu$m. The average slope
	of this relation with depth remained similar over the range of injury
	intensity examined, though the slope appeared inversely related to
	variation in axonal survival for different individuals at a given
	intensity. It is argued that the loss of axons is probably determined
	primarily by mechanical stretch at the time of impact. Its centrifugal
	pattern may be explained by longitudinal displacement of the central
	contents of the cord, reflecting the viscoelastic â€œboundary layerâ€�
	properties of parenchymal flow within the meningeal tube. This is
	illustrated with reference to the behavior of a gelatin model under
	compression. The preferential loss of large caliber axons and the
	characteristic shift to abnormally thin myelm sheaths (resulting
	from post-traumatic demyelination) both varied in extent independently
	of injury intensity and overall axonal survival. These effects are
	concluded to be the result of independent processes, triggered by
	traumatic injury, apparently delayed in time, but ultimately superimposed
	on the initial mechanical disruption.},

  abstract = {Axotomy of nerve fibers leads to the subsequent degeneration of their
	distal part, a process termed Wallerian degeneration (WD). While
	WD in the peripheral nervous system is usually followed by regeneration
	of the lesioned axons, central nervous system (CNS) neurons are generally
	unable to regrow. In this study, we investigated the process of WD
	in the dorsal columns of the rat spinal cord rostral to a mid-thoracic
	lesion. We confirm earlier studies describing a very delayed microglial
	and an early and sustained astroglial reaction finally leading to
	scar formation. Interestingly, we found a differential time course
	in the loss of myelin proteins depending on their location. Proteins
	situated on the periaxonal myelin membrane such as myelin associated
	glycoprotein disappeared early, within a few days after lesion, concomitantly
	with cytoskeletal axonal proteins, whereas compact myelin and outer
	myelin membrane proteins such as MBP and Nogo-A remained for long
	intervals in the degenerating tracts. Two distinct mechanisms are
	probably responsible for this difference: processes of protein destruction
	emanating from and initially probably located in the axon act on
	a time scale of 1-3 days. In contrast, the bulk of myelin destruction
	is due to phagocytosis known to be slow, prolonged, and inefficient
	in the CNS. These results may also have implications for future intervention
	strategies aiming at enhancing CNS regeneration.},

  abstract = {Characterizing demyelination/degeneration of spinal pathways in traumatic
	spinal cord injured (SCI) patients is crucial for assessing the prognosis
	of functional rehabilitation. Novel techniques based on diffusion-weighted
	(DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetization transfer
	(MT) imaging provide sensitive and specific markers of white matter
	pathology. In this paper we combined for the first time high angular
	resolution diffusion-weighted imaging (HARDI), MT imaging and atrophy
	measurements to evaluate the cervical spinal cord of fourteen SCI
	patients and age-matched controls. We used high in-plane resolution
	to delineate dorsal and ventrolateral pathways. Significant differences
	were detected between patients and controls in the normal-appearing
	white matter for fractional anisotropy (FA, p<0.0001), axial diffusivity
	(p<0.05), radial diffusivity (p<0.05), generalized fractional anisotropy
	(GFA, p<0.0001), magnetization transfer ratio (MTR, p<0.0001) and
	cord area (p<0.05). No significant difference was detected in mean
	diffusivity (p=0.41), T1-weighted (p=0.76) and T2-weighted (p=0.09)
	signals. MRI metrics were remarkably well correlated with clinical
	disability (Pearson's correlations, FA: p<0.01, GFA: p<0.01, radial
	diffusivity: p=0.01, MTR: p=0.04 and atrophy: p<0.01). Stepwise linear
	regressions showed that measures of MTR in the dorsal spinal cord
	predicted the sensory disability whereas measures of MTR in the ventro-lateral
	spinal cord predicted the motor disability (ASIA score). However,
	diffusion metrics were not specific to the sensorimotor scores. Due
	to the specificity of axial and radial diffusivity and MT measurements,
	results suggest the detection of demyelination and degeneration in
	SCI patients. Combining HARDI with MT imaging is a promising approach
	to gain specificity in characterizing spinal cord pathways in traumatic
	injury.},

	have been successfully established in animal models. For their use
	in trials of spinal-cord injury (SCI) in human beings, specific difficulties
	that affect the success of clinical trials have to be recognised.
	First, transection of the spinal cord is commonly applied in animal
	models, whereas contusion, which generally leads to injury in two
	to three segments, represents the typical injury mechanism in human
	beings. Second, the quadrupedal organisation of locomotion in animals
	and the more complex autonomic functions in human beings, challenge
	translation of animal behaviour into recovery from SCI in people.
	Third, the extensive damage of motor neurons and roots associated
	with spinal-cord contusion is not addressed in current translational
	studies. This damage has direct implications for rehabilitation strategies
	and functional outcome. Fourth, there is increasing evidence for
	a degradation of neuronal function below the level of the lesion
	in chronic complete SCI. The relevance of this degradation for a
	regeneration-inducing treatment needs to be investigated. Fifth,
	the prerequisites to enable appropriate reconnection of regenerating
	tract fibres in a postacute stage have still to be established.},

	depend on a dynamic interaction between the severity of local damage
	and the capacity of the brain for plastic reorganization. We investigated
	trauma-induced anatomical changes in the spinal cord and brain, and
	explored their relationship to functional changes in sensorimotor
	cortex. Structural changes were assessed using cross-sectional cord
	area, voxel-based morphometry and voxel-based cortical thickness
	of T1-weighted images in 10 subjects with cervical spinal cord injury
	and 16 controls. Cortical activation in response to right-sided (i)
	handgrip; and (ii) median and tibial nerve stimulation were assessed
	using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Regression analyses
	explored associations between cord area, grey and white matter volume,
	cortical activations and thickness, and disability. Subjects with
	spinal cord injury had impaired upper and lower limb function bilaterally,
	a 30\% reduced cord area, smaller white matter volume in the pyramids
	and left cerebellar peduncle, and smaller grey matter volume and
	cortical thinning in the leg area of the primary motor and sensory
	cortex compared with controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging
	revealed increased activation in the left primary motor cortex leg
	area during handgrip and the left primary sensory cortex face area
	during median nerve stimulation in subjects with spinal cord injury
	compared with controls, but no increased activation following tibial
	nerve stimulation. A smaller cervical cord area was associated with
	impaired upper limb function and increased activations with handgrip
	and median nerve stimulation, but reduced activations with tibial
	nerve stimulation. Increased sensory deficits were associated with
	increased activations in the left primary sensory cortex face area
	due to median nerve stimulation. In conclusion, spinal cord injury
	leads to cord atrophy, cortical atrophy of primary motor and sensory
	cortex, and cortical reorganization of the sensorimotor system. The
	degree of cortical reorganization is predicted by spinal atrophy
	and is associated with significant disability.},

	We compare the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation to an analytical

	and updates for a given run time by trading off number of updates
	in favor of number of spins such that precision and accuracy of sythesized
	data are both optimized. Further experiments demonstrate the system
	using a tissue environment that current analytic models cannot capture.
	This tissue model incorporates swelling, abutting, and deformation.
	Swelling-induced restriction in the extracellular space due to the
	effects of abutting cylinders leads to large departures from the
	predictions of the analytical model, which does not capture these
	effects. This swelling-induced restriction may be an important mechanism

	-0.04. Good cross-sectional correlations were found between the EDSS

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and quantitative T(2) magnetic
	resonance imaging (MRI) were used to characterize ex vivo the white
	matter damage at 3 and 8 weeks following dorsal column transection
	(DC Tx) injury at the cervical level C5 of rat spinal cords. Luxol
	Fast Blue (LFB) and myelin basic protein (MBP) staining was used
	to assess myelin damage, and neurofilament-H in combination with
	neuron specific beta-III-tubulin (NF/Tub) staining was used to assess
	axonal damage. Average values of myelin water fraction (MWF), fractional
	anisotropy (FA), longitudinal diffusivity (D(long)), transverse diffusivity
	(D(trans)), and average diffusivity (D(ave)) were calculated in the
	fasciculus gracilis, fasciculus cuneatus, and the dorsal corticospinal
	tract (CST) 5 mm cranial, as well as 5 and 10 mm caudal to injury
	and correlated with histology. These tracts were selected as these
	contain bundles of parallel ascending and descending axons in very
	circumscribed areas with little intermingling of other axonal populations.
	Axonal and myelin degeneration occur cranial to injury in the funiculus
	gracilis and caudal to injury in the CST. Both MWF and D(trans) showed
	significant correlation with LFB staining at 3 weeks (0.64 and -0.49,
	respectively) and 8 weeks post-injury (0.88 and -0.71, respectively).
	Both D(long) and FA correlated significantly with NF/Tub staining
	at 3 weeks post-injury (0.78 and 0.64, respectively), while only
	D(long) displayed significant correlation 8 weeks post-injury (0.58
	and 0.33, respectively). This study demonstrates that quantitative
	MRI can accurately characterize white matter damage in DC Tx model
	of injury in rat spinal cord.},

  abstract = {The number, types, and distribution of distinct classes of axons and
	glia in four cerebral commissures of the adult rhesus monkey (Macaca
	mulatta) were determined using electron microscopic and immunocytochemical
	methods. The two neocortical commissures, the corpus callosum, and
	the anterior commissure contain small but cytologically distinct
	archicortical components: the hippocampal commissure, which lies
	ventral to the splenium of the corpus callosum, and the basal telencephalic
	commissure, which forms a small crescent at the anterior margin of
	the anterior commissure. Each archicortical pathway is delineated
	from the adjacent neocortical commissure by a glial capsule. The
	glia cells that form this border are immunoreactive with antisera
	directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and issue
	long processes that form numerous desmosomal junctions with one another.
	Braids of these glial processes envelop axonal fascicles within the
	archicortical commissures. In contrast, the GFAP-positive cells of
	the corpus callosum and anterior commissure are randomly distributed
	cells with relatively short stellate processes that do not form boundaries
	around axon fascicles. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis
	reveals that approximately 60 million axons connect the two cerebral
	hemispheres: the corpus callosum contains 56.0 million +/- 3.8 million
	axons (n = 8), the anterior commissure contains 3.15 million +/-
	0.24 million axons (n = 8), the hippocampal commissure has 237,000
	axons +/- 31,000 (n = 6), and the basal telencephalic commissure
	has 193,000 axons +/- 28,000 (n = 5). The number of axons is not
	directly proportional to the cross-sectional area in any of the commissures
	because of variation in axonal composition. On the basis of an estimate
	of approximately 3 billion neurons in the monkey cortex (Shariff,
	'53), we estimate that between 2 and 3\% of all cortical neurons
	project to the opposite cerebral hemisphere. Subregions of the corpus
	callosum as well as each of the other commissures consist of characteristic
	subsets of five classes of axons and contain different proportions
	of myelinated to unmyelinated fibers. The largest myelinated axons
	and the smallest proportion of unmyelinated axons (approximately
	6\%) are found in regions of the corpus callosum that carry projections
	from primary sensory cortices, whereas the smallest myelinated axons
	and largest proportion of unmyelinated axons (approximately 30\%)
	are found in regions of the corpus callosum that carry projections
	from association cortices. Axon composition in the anterior commissure
	is uniform and resembles that of callosal sectors that contain association
	projections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	importance of spinal cord atrophy (implicating axonal loss) in the

	initial studies have poor reproducibility which limits their application
	in the serial monitoring of patients. The aim of this study was to
	develop a highly reproducible and accurate method for the quantification
	of atrophy. The technique we describe demonstrates an intra-observer
	coefficient of variation (scan-rescan) of only 0.8\%. When applied
	to 60 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis there
	was a strong correlation between spinal cord area and disability
	measured by Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Status Scale(EDSS) (r =
	-0.7, P<<0.001). The correlation was graded providing evidence for
	a causal connection. At levels 3 and 8 of the EDSS we observed a
	reduction in average cord area of 12 and 35\%,respectively. Given
	its reproducibility, the magnitude of the change detected and the
	strong correlation with disability, this new technique should prove
	to be a sensitive measure of progressive neurological deterioration
	and could be readily incorporated into imaging protocols aimed at
	monitoring therapy.},

	We measured indices derived from the diffusion tensor (DT) and T2-weighted
	signal intensities in the descending motor pathways of patients with
	small chronic lacunar infarcts of the posterior limb of the internal
	capsule on one side. We compared these measurements in the healthy
	and lesioned sides at different levels in the brainstem caudal to
	the primary lesion. We found that secondary white matter degeneration
	is revealed by a large reduction in diffusion anisotropy only in
	regions where fibers are arranged in isolated bundles of parallel
	fibers, such as in the cerebral peduncle. In regions where the degenerated
	pathway crosses other tracts, such as in the rostral pons, paradoxically
	there is almost no change in diffusion anisotropy, but a significant
	change in the measured orientation of fibers. The trace of the diffusion
	tensor is moderately increased in all affected regions. This allows
	one to differentiate secondary and primary fiber loss where the increase
	in trace is considerably higher. We show that DT-MRI is more sensitive
	than T2-weighted MRI in detecting Wallerian degeneration. Significant
	diffusion abnormalities are observed over the entire trajectory of
	the affected pathway in each patient. This finding suggests that
	mapping degenerated pathways noninvasively with DT-MRI is feasible.
	However, the interpretation of water diffusion data is complex and
	requires a priori information about anatomy and architecture of the
	pathway under investigation. In particular, our study shows that
	in regions where fibers cross, existing DT-MRI-based fiber tractography
	algorithms may lead to erroneous conclusion about brain connectivity.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is being used to probe the central
	nervous system (CNS) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), a
	chronic demyelinating disease. Conventional T(2)-weighted MRI (cMRI)
	largely fails to predict the degree of patients' disability. This
	shortcoming may be due to poor specificity of cMRI for clinically
	relevant pathology. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has shown promise
	to be more specific for MS pathology. In this study we investigated
	the association between histological indices of myelin content, axonal
	count and gliosis, and two measures of DTI (mean diffusivity [MD]
	and fractional anisotropy [FA]), in unfixed post mortem MS brain
	using a 1.5-T MR system. Both MD and FA were significantly lower
	in post mortem MS brain compared to published data acquired in vivo.
	However, the differences of MD and FA described in vivo between white
	matter lesions (WMLs) and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) were
	retained in this study of post mortem brain: average MD in WMLs was
	0.35x10(-3) mm(2)/s (SD, 0.09) versus 0.22 (0.04) in NAWM; FA was
	0.22 (0.06) in WMLs versus 0.38 (0.13) in NAWM. Correlations were
	detected between myelin content (Tr(myelin)) and (i) FA (r=-0.79,
	p<0.001), (ii) MD (r=0.68, p<0.001), and (iii) axonal count (r=-0.81,
	p<0.001). Multiple regression suggested that these correlations largely
	explain the apparent association of axonal count with (i) FA (r=0.70,
	p<0.001) and (ii) MD (r=-0.66, p<0.001). In conclusion, this study
	suggests that FA and MD are affected by myelin content and - to a
	lesser degree - axonal count in post mortem MS brain.},

	Each may have significant impact on the long-term disability of patients.
	Currently, there does not exist a noninvasive biological marker that

	herein the use of magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
	to quantify the effect of dysmyelination on water directional diffusivities
	in brains of shiverer mice in vivo. The principal diffusion eigenvalues
	of eight axonal fiber tracts that can be identified with certainty
	on DTI maps were measured. The water diffusivity perpendicular to
	axonal fiber tracts, $\lambda$âŠ¥, was significantly higher in shiverer
	mice compared with age-matched controls, reflecting the lack of myelin
	and the increased freedom of cross-fiber diffusion in white matter.
	The water diffusivity parallel to axonal fiber tracts, $\lambda$âˆ¥,
	was not different, which is consistent with the presence of intact
	axons. It is clear that dysmyelination alone does not impact $\lambda$âˆ¥.
	The presence of intact axons in the setting of incomplete myelination
	was confirmed by electron microscopy. Although further validation
	is still needed, our finding suggests that changes in $\lambda$âŠ¥
	and $\lambda$âˆ¥ may potentially be used to differentiate myelin
	loss versus axonal injury.},

	treatment. Subsequently, radial diffusivity decreases with the progression

	constitutes a significant component of the pathology in compressive

	demyelinated axons surrounds a central core of hemorrhagic necrosis.
	This provides a pathophysiological basis for â€œdiscompleteâ€� spinal
	cord injuries, characterized by apparently complete transection as
	judged by clinical criteria, but with neurophysiological evidence
	of conduction through the level of damage. Recovery of conduction
	in demyelinated axons may permit recovery of function, and can be
	mediated by several mechanisms, including remyelination by oligodendrocytes
	or Schwann cells. Alternatively, conduction of action potentials
	can occur in the absence of remyelination, but this requires plasticity
	of the demyelinated axon. The biophysics of conduction favors recovery
	of electrogenesis after demyelination of small diameter axons. This
	may account, in part, for the observation that functional recovery
	is more common after demyelination of visual, compared to spinal,
	axons. Restoration or modification of conduction in demyelinated
	fibers represents an important strategy for promoting functional
	recovery in spinal cord injury.},

	the loss of motor control. Although the goal of most SCI treatments
	is to re-establish neural connections, a potential complication in
	restoring motor function is that SCI may result in anatomical and
	functional changes in brain areas controlling motor output. Some
	animal investigations show cell death in the primary motor cortex
	following SCI, but similar anatomical changes in humans are not yet
	established. The aim of this investigation was to use voxel-based
	morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to determine
	if SCI in humans results in anatomical changes within motor cortices
	and descending motor pathways. Using VBM, we found significantly
	lower gray matter volume in complete SCI subjects compared with controls
	in the primary motor cortex, the medial prefrontal, and adjacent
	anterior cingulate cortices. DTI analysis revealed structural abnormalities
	in the same areas with reduced gray matter volume and in the superior
	cerebellar cortex. In addition, tractography revealed structural
	abnormalities in the corticospinal and corticopontine tracts of the
	SCI subjects. In conclusion, human subjects with complete SCI show
	structural changes in cortical motor regions and descending motor
	tracts, and these brain anatomical changes may limit motor recovery
	following SCI.},

  abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and immunohistochemistry were used
	to examine axon injury in the rat spinal cord after unilateral L(2)-L(4)
	dorsal root axotomy at multiple time points (from 16 h to 30 d after
	surgery). Three days after axotomy, DTI revealed a lesion in the
	ipsilateral dorsal column extending from the lumbar to the cervical
	cord. The lesion showed significantly reduced parallel diffusivity
	and increased perpendicular diffusivity at day 3 compared with the
	contralateral unlesioned dorsal column. These findings coincided
	with loss of phosphorylated neurofilaments, accumulation of nonphosphorylated
	neurofilaments, swollen axons and formation of myelin ovoids, and
	no clear loss of myelin (stained by Luxol fast blue and 2'-3'-cyclic
	nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase). At day 30, DTI of the lesion continued
	to show significantly decreased parallel diffusivity. There was a
	slow but significant increase in perpendicular diffusivity between
	day 3 and day 30, which correlated with gradual clearance of myelin
	without further significant changes in neurofilament levels. These
	results show that parallel diffusivity can detect axon degeneration
	within 3 d after injury. The clearance of myelin at later stages
	may contribute to the late increase in perpendicular diffusivity,
	whereas the cause of its early increase at day 3 may be related to
	changes associated with primary axon injury. These data suggest that
	there is an early imaging signature associated with axon transections
	that could be used in a variety of neurological disease processes.},
