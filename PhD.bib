@article{Bar-Shir:2008,
	Abstract = {High b-value q-space diffusion MRS was used to study the diffusion characteristics of formalin-fixed swine optic and sciatic nerves over a large range of diffusion times (3.7-99.3 ms). The very short diffusion time range was studied with a 1 ms resolution. The displacement distribution profiles obtained were fitted to a bi-Gaussian function, and structural parameters were extracted from the q-space diffusion MRS data. This structural information was correlated with axon sizes obtained by histological examination. It was found that high b-value q-space diffusion MRS can easily distinguish between the two nerve types. The root mean square displacements (rmsds) of both the slow and fast diffusing components of the optic nerves were found to be smaller than those of the sciatic nerves. When the rmsd was plotted against the square root of the diffusion time (t(d)(1/2)), it was found that all four components showed an increase in rmsd; this increase was significantly smaller than expected from the Einstein equation. However, the most restricted component is the slow diffusing component of the optic nerve. This is also the only diffusing component that shows a large change in the slope (i.e. a 'breaking point') of the plot of rmsd as a function of t(d)(1/2). This rmsd is very similar to the mean axon size of these optic nerves determined histologically. Such a change in slope was less apparent for the slow diffusing component of sciatic nerves, which showed a wider distribution of axon size in histological images. The fast diffusing components of both nerve types showed only a small gradual change in the slope of rmsd plotted against t(d)(1/2). These findings are discussed in the context of component assignment, origin of restriction, and relationships between the structural information extracted from q-space diffusion MRS and histological examination.},

@article{Bar-Shir:2008a,
	Abstract = {q-Space diffusion MRI (QSI) provides a means of obtaining microstructural information about porous materials and neuronal tissues from diffusion data. However, the accuracy of this structural information depends on experimental parameters used to collect the MR data. q-Space diffusion MR performed on clinical scanners is generally collected with relatively long diffusion gradient pulses, in which the gradient pulse duration, delta, is comparable to the diffusion time, Delta. In this study, we used phantoms, consisting of ensembles of microtubes, and mathematical models to assess the effect of the ratio of the diffusion time and the duration of the diffusion pulse gradient, i.e., Delta/delta, on the MR signal attenuation vs. q, and on the measured structural information extracted therefrom. We found that for Delta/delta approximately 1, the diffraction pattern obtained from q-space MR data are shallower than when the short gradient pulse (SGP) approximation is satisfied. For long delta the estimated compartment size is, as expected, smaller than the real size. Interestingly, for Delta/delta approximately 1 the diffraction peaks are shifted to even higher q-values, even when delta is kept constant, giving the impression that the restricted compartments are even smaller than they are. When phantoms composed of microtubes of different diameters are used, it is more difficult to estimate the diameter distribution in this regime. Excellent agreement is found between the experimental results and simulations that explicitly account for the use of long duration gradient pulses. Using such experimental data and this mathematical framework, one can estimate the true compartment dimensions when long and finite gradient pulses are used even when Delta/delta approximately 1.},

	Abstract = {The diffusion tensor is currently the accepted model of diffusion in biological tissues. The measured diffusion behavior may be more complex when two or more distinct tissues with different diffusion tensors occupy the same voxel. In this study, a partial volume model of MRI signal behavior for two diffusion-tensor compartments is presented. Simulations using this model demonstrate that the conventional single diffusion tensor model could lead to highly variable and inaccurate measurements of diffusion behavior. The differences between the single and two-tensor models depend on the orientations, fractions, and exchange between the two diffusion tensor compartments, as well as the diffusion-tensor encoding technique and diffusion-weighting that is used in the measurements. The current single compartment model's inaccuracies could cause diffusion-based characterization of cerebral ischemia and white matter connectivity to be incorrect. A diffusion-tensor MRI imaging experiment on a normal human brain revealed significant partial volume effects between oblique white matter regions when using very large voxels and large diffusion-weighting (b approximately 2.69 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)). However, the apparent partial volume effects in white matter decreased significantly when smaller voxel dimensions were used. For diffusion tensor studies obtained using typical diffusion-weighting values (b approximately 1 x 10(3) sec/mm(2)) partial volume effects are much more difficult to detect and resolve. More accurate measurements of multiple diffusion compartments may lead to improved confidence in diffusion measurements for clinical applications.},

	Abstract = {After perfusion fixation with a mixture of paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and potassium-chromate 4 adult human medullary pyramids were examined with the electron microscope. The myelin sheaths showed only mild signs of post mortal destructions. The periodicity of the lamellae is preserved and varies about 17 nm. For quantitative purposes specimens were taken at random from regions with an extend of half a mm2 on the cross section of the pyramid. On the average 62 lamellae (s = 5, n = 200) built up 1 micron myelin sheath in the 4 brains. The myelin sheath thickness and the inner circumference of the myelin sheath are measured. The axon diameter is calculated from the inner circumference. We obtained an average number of 66,000 fibres, s = 11,000 per mm2. Fibres with a total diameter below 4 microns amount to 87.9\%, fibres from 4 to 10 microns to 10.77\%, and larger than 10 microns to 1.4\%. An axon diameter of about 0.5 micron combined with a thickness of the myelin sheath of 0.3 micron was most often found in all 4 cases. The fibres showed a broad variation of myelin thickness. In a given group of the small axons the thickest myelin sheath exceeded 3 to 4 times the value of the thinnest one. The coefficient of correlation between axon diameter and myelin sheath thickness was calculated as r2 = 0.56. No correspondence exists between frequency maxima and the ratio g, axon diameter to total diameter. Below a total fibre diameter of 5 microns the ratio g scatters broadly about 0.6, fibres larger than 5 microns exceed the value of 0.6. From the morphological data only large sized fibres can evoke a strong effect on compound action potentials if the method of reconstruction of the action potential from fibre size frequency distribution is employed.},

	Abstract = {The densities of fibers of different sizes were calculated in ten regions of the corpus callosum of twenty human brains (ten females, ten males). Light microscopic examination revealed a consistent pattern of regional differentiation of fiber types in the corpus callosum. Thin fibers are most dense in the anterior corpus callosum (genu), and decrease in density posteriorly towards the posterior midbody, where they reach a minimum. Towards the posterior corpus callosum (splenium), the density of thin fibers increases again, but in the posterior pole of the callosum the density decreases locally. Large-diameter fibers show a pattern complementary to that of thin fibers, having a peak of density in the posterior midbody and a local increase of density in the posterior pole of the corpus callosum. Across subjects, the overall density of callosal fibers had no significant correlation with callosal area and an increased callosal area indicated an increased total number of fibers crossing through. Considering different fiber sizes, this was only true for small diameter fibers, whose large majority is believed to interconnect association cortex. No sex differences in fiber composition of the corpus callosum were found.},

@article{Hall:2009,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a general and flexible Monte- Carlo simulation framework for diffusing spins that generates realistic synthetic data for diffusion magnetic resonance imaging. Similar systems in the literature consider only simple substrates and their authors do not consider convergence and parameter optimization. We show how to run Monte-Carlo simulations within complex irregular substrates. We compare the results of the Monte-Carlo simulation to an analytical model of restricted diffusion to assess precision and accuracy of the generated results. We obtain an optimal combination of spins and updates for a given run time by trading off number of updates in favor of number of spins such that precision and accuracy of sythesized data are both optimized. Further experiments demonstrate the system using a tissue environment that current analytic models cannot capture. This tissue model incorporates swelling, abutting, and deformation. Swelling-induced restriction in the extracellular space due to the effects of abutting cylinders leads to large departures from the predictions of the analytical model, which does not capture these effects. This swelling-induced restriction may be an important mechanism in explaining the changes in apparent diffusion constant observed in the aftermath of acute ischemic stroke.},

	Abstract = {There have been several recent reports concerning individual differences in the gross morphometry of the human corpus callosum. However, no studies exist on individual differences in the fiber composition of the corpus callosum. Here we report for the first time the relation of fiber composition in specific callosal segments (as seen in light microscopy) to anatomical asymmetries in language-gifted cortex, as a function of sex. We found a significant negative correlation between Sylvian fissure asymmetries and the total numbers of fibers in the isthmus of males, and in the anterior splenium of females. In addition, a population of relatively large fibers (between 1 micron and 3 microns in diameter) in the isthmus showed a strong negative correlation with perisylvian asymmetries only in males. These findings suggest a sex-dependent, pathway-specific decrease in interhemispheric connectivity with increasing lateralization.},

@article{Lamantia:1990,
	Abstract = {The number, types, and distribution of distinct classes of axons and glia in four cerebral commissures of the adult rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) were determined using electron microscopic and immunocytochemical methods. The two neocortical commissures, the corpus callosum, and the anterior commissure contain small but cytologically distinct archicortical components: the hippocampal commissure, which lies ventral to the splenium of the corpus callosum, and the basal telencephalic commissure, which forms a small crescent at the anterior margin of the anterior commissure. Each archicortical pathway is delineated from the adjacent neocortical commissure by a glial capsule. The glia cells that form this border are immunoreactive with antisera directed against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and issue long processes that form numerous desmosomal junctions with one another. Braids of these glial processes envelop axonal fascicles within the archicortical commissures. In contrast, the GFAP-positive cells of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure are randomly distributed cells with relatively short stellate processes that do not form boundaries around axon fascicles. Quantitative electron microscopic analysis reveals that approximately 60 million axons connect the two cerebral hemispheres: the corpus callosum contains 56.0 million +/- 3.8 million axons (n = 8), the anterior commissure contains 3.15 million +/- 0.24 million axons (n = 8), the hippocampal commissure has 237,000 axons +/- 31,000 (n = 6), and the basal telencephalic commissure has 193,000 axons +/- 28,000 (n = 5). The number of axons is not directly proportional to the cross-sectional area in any of the commissures because of variation in axonal composition. On the basis of an estimate of approximately 3 billion neurons in the monkey cortex (Shariff, '53), we estimate that between 2 and 3\% of all cortical neurons project to the opposite cerebral hemisphere. Subregions of the corpus callosum as well as each of the other commissures consist of characteristic subsets of five classes of axons and contain different proportions of myelinated to unmyelinated fibers. The largest myelinated axons and the smallest proportion of unmyelinated axons (approximately 6\%) are found in regions of the corpus callosum that carry projections from primary sensory cortices, whereas the smallest myelinated axons and largest proportion of unmyelinated axons (approximately 30\%) are found in regions of the corpus callosum that carry projections from association cortices. Axon composition in the anterior commissure is uniform and resembles that of callosal sectors that contain association projections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},
