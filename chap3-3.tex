As discussed above (see Section~\ref{sec:qspace}), various studies on experimental MRI systems have shown that \gls{QSI} can provide accurate information about microscopic restriction in excised tissue \citep{Assaf:2000,Bar-Shir:2008,Ong:2008}. \gls{QSI} requires an extensive sampling of different $q$-values. This restricts the number of diffusion gradient directions that can be sampled when scan time is limited. Therefore, application of \gls{QSI} in the \gls{CNS} mostly focuses on the \gls{SC} since its relatively simple white matter structure doesn't require high angular resolution of gradient directions. \Citep{Ong:2008,Ong:2010,Ong:2011} measured \gls{QSI} parameters in different white matter tracts of excised rat spinal cord and were able to correlate the \gls{QSI} parameters with the axon diameter in different white matter regions. Although the conditions for true \gls{QSI}, such as the short gradient pulse, are impossible to achieve in clinical systems, studies such as \cite{TODO} in the human brain and \citet{Farrell:2008} in the spinal cord have shown the great potential in the assessment of {\gls{SC}} white matter and white pathologies such as MS. With the emerge of \gls{QSI}However, most clinical \gls{QSI} studies only focused on a small number of patients and failed to demonstrate the reliability of \gls{QSI}. The aim of this study is to report reproducibility of \gls{QSI} metrics in the cervical {\gls{SC}} on a standard 3T clinical MRI scanner. We also assessed \gls{QSI} measures both in-plane (XY) and parallel to the main {\gls{SC}} axis (Z), not presented before. We compare \gls{QSI} measures derived in gray matter and different ascending and descending white tracts of the cervical {\gls{SC}} in healthy subjects and investigate associations between \gls{QSI} parameters and conventional apparent diffusion coefficient (\gls{ADC}) measures, both in plane and along the cord. \subsection*{Methods} \paragraph{Study design \& Data acquisition:} We recruited 9 right-handed male healthy subjects (mean age 35±11yrs) to be scanned on a 3T Tim Trio (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen). Three subjects were recalled for a second scan on a different day to assess intra-subject reproducibility of \gls{QSI} derived parameters. We performed cardiac-gated high {\gls{bvalue}} axial{\gls{DWI}}(matrix=96x96, b-spline interpolated to 192x192 in image space, FOV=144x144mm2, slice thickness=5mm, 20 slices, TE=110ms, TR≈4000ms) with 32 b values between 0-3000s/mm2 in b=50s/mm2 steps (gradient duration=45ms, diffusion time=55ms, maximum {\gls{gstr}} strength=23mT/m). Three different{\gls{DWI}}directions were acquired: two directions perpendicular (XY) and one parallel (Z) to the main {\gls{SC}} axis. The two perpendicular diffusion directions were averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. The measurements were linearly regridded to be equidistant in q-space and the  {\gls{dpdf}} was computed using inverse fast Fourier transformation. To increase the resolution of the  {\gls{dpdf}}, the signal was extrapolated in q-space to a maximum q=166mm$^{-1}$ by fitting a bi-exponential decay curve to the{\gls{DWI}}data as in \citet{Cohen:2002, Farrell:2008}. Maps of the full width at half maximum and zero displacement probability were derived for XY and Z as described in Section~\ref{sec:qspace}. For comparison we also computed the apparent diffusion coefficient (see section \ref{subsec:adc}) from the monoexponential part of the decay curve (b≤1100s/mm2) as in \citet{Farrell:2008} for both XY and Z directions. \paragraph{ROI analysis:} We semi-automatically delineate the whole cervical {\gls{SC}} area (SCA) between levels C1 and C3 on the b=0 images using the active surface segmentation by \citet{Horsfield:2010} available in Jim6. We perform a morphological erosion (2 iterations) of the obtained segmentation mask to exclude voxels with potential partial-volume average effect from surrounding \gls{CSF}. In addition, four regions of interest were manually placed in specific white matter tracts and one ROI was positioned in the gray matter on all slices between level C1 and C3. The four white matter regions comprised the left and right tracts (l\&r-LT) running in the lateral columns and the anterior (AT) and posterior tracts (PT) similar to \citet{Hesseltine:2006,Freund:2010}. \paragraph{Statistical processing:} We report reproducibility as the intra-subject coefficient of variation (COV=SD measurements/mean measurements) for the three scan/rescan subjects and the inter-subject COV among all nine subjects. Further, we compare significant differences in the group mean values of the \gls{ADC} parameters (\gls{ADC}xy, \gls{ADC}z) and \gls{QSI} metrics (\gls{P0}xy, \gls{P0}z, \gls{FWHM}xy, \gls{FWHM}z) between tracts by performing the Hotellings-T2 test (confidence interval=99\%). To investigate the relevance of measurements in the Z direction, we compute the same significance test of XY-only \gls{QSI} parameters (\gls{P0}xy, \gls{FWHM}xy). Finally, we investigate the relationship between individual \gls{ADC} and \gls{QSI} measurements in XY and Z directions for each tract using the Spearman’s $\rho$ correlation coefficient. \subsection*{Results} \begin{figure}  \centering  \pgfimage[width=12cm]{pictures/chap3/sec3/cov.pdf}  \captionbelow{Intra- and inter-subject COV for QSI and ADC parameters.}  \label{fig:experiment3_QSIvariations}\end{figure}\paragraph{Reproducibility:} In both intra-subject scan/rescan experiments and among subjects we observe a consistently lower COV in \gls{QSI} metrics compared to \gls{ADC} measurements (see Figure~\ref{fig:experiment3_QSIvariations}). In particular, \gls{ADC}xy shows the largest intra- and inter-subject variation (>25\%) in most tracts. In contrast, tract-specific \gls{QSI} measurements vary less, and the majority of observed CoVs are between 5-10\%. \paragraph{Tract-specific differences:} Figure~\ref{fig:experiment3_tractplots} reports \gls{QSI} and \gls{ADC} values among all 9 subjects. We find significant group differences in \gls{QSI} and \gls{ADC} parameters between different white matter tracts. In particular, there are significant differences in the \gls{ADC}xy and \gls{ADC}z between the PT, AT and lateral tracts (p<0.01) that are not observable with \gls{QSI} parameters. On the other hand, XY and Z \gls{QSI} parameters showed significant differences between left and right lateral tracts (p<0.01), as well as differences between AT and l-LT (p<0.05). However, perpendicular \gls{QSI} metrics alone do not show significant differences in any white matter tract. Both \gls{ADC} and \gls{QSI} metrics are significantly different between white matter tracts and gray matter (p<0.001). Figure~\ref{fig:experiment3_singlesubjectDPDF} which shows the detailed displacement profiles in one exemplary subject. It becomes even more apparent that the tract specific differences in the  {\gls{dpdf}}s are not limited to the XY plane but the profiles are also distinguishable in the Z direction.\begin{figure}  \centering  \pgfimage[width=\textwidth]{pictures/chap3/sec3/qval-plots.pdf}  \captionbelow{Mean and standard error of tract-specific QSI and ADC in XY and Z direction over all subjects.}  \label{fig:experiment3_tractplots}\end{figure} \begin{figure}  \centering  \pgfimage[width=9cm]{pictures/chap3/sec3/demo-tracts.pdf}  \captionbelow{Exemplary FWHM maps and DPDFs in five voxels placed in white matter tracts AT, PT, l\&r-LT as well as inside GM for XY and Z directions.}  \label{fig:experiment3_singlesubjectDPDF}\end{figure}%TODO: hotelling and correlation matrix \paragraph{QSI and ADC correlation:} We further observe significant correlations between \gls{ADC} and \gls{QSI} parameters in both XY and Z direction in all tracts. In XY direction, the strongest associations between \gls{FWHM}xy and ADCx are found in AT and PT (p<0.001, $\rho$>0.8), although weaker correlations are also found in the r-LT (p<0.05, $\rho$=0.66). In Z direction, we find strong positive correlations only in PT and l-LT between \gls{ADC}z and \gls{FWHM}z (p<0.001, $\rho$>0.9) and negative correlation with \gls{P0}z (p<0.001, $\rho$<-0.8) respectively. Over the whole SCA, we found correlation between all XY and Z measurements: the strongest correlation is found between ADCz and \gls{P0}z (p<0.01, $\rho$=-0.9) and a weak correlation is found between ADCxy and \gls{FWHM}xy(p<0.05, $\rho$>0.7) and \gls{P0}xy(p<0.05, $\rho$<-0.7). \subsection*{Discussion \& Conclusion} \gls{QSI} metrics obtained without sequence development, using standard{\gls{DWI}}protocol available on a 3T clinical scanner, show a good reproducibility that is superior to simple \gls{ADC} analysis. We observe tract-specific correlations between \gls{ADC} and \gls{QSI} parameters. However, especially in the lateral tracts, associations are weaker than in the anterior and posterior tracts, suggesting additional information in both XY and Z from \gls{QSI} analysis in these columns. We further demonstrate that \gls{QSI} parameters provides complementary metrics that allow discrimination of white matter tracts in healthy controls that cannot be distinguished with \gls{ADC} alone. Our findings also suggest that the Z direction provides additional information to perpendicular measurements.
